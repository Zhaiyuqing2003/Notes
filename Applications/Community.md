In the design of an autograder for the algorithms course under Jeff Erickson, I had to work in very close collaboration with colleagues on the design of an intuitive learning tool for students within PrairieLearn. My role involves designing questions and making sure the interface is user-friendly so that students can then practice effectively and perform better on exams. We would demo each other our progress and share our ideas during our weekly meeting about how to improve it. These often turned into long debates, sometimes over an hour, as we carefully refined the interface to balance usability, fairness, and clarity. In this process, I learned to value the incorporation of diverse perspectives and the reaching of consensus that leads to polished, student-friendly outcomes.

Besides, as an ECE department lab assistant, I worked hands-on with the students, helping them troubleshoot both circuits and oscilloscope setups. Since each student approached problems differently, it requires me to adapt my explanation best fitted to their individual understanding, and offering students indirect hints to ensure they could solve problems independently while feeling supported.

I have learnt essential skills for collaboration and ensuring inclusivity from these experiences. By listening to diverse viewpoints, whether in refining an autograder or guiding students in a lab, I learned how to build supportive, productive environments where everyone could succeed.
