I want to do research in topics like programming languages, compilers, and program verification. Through my undergraduate studies, I have gained a solid foundation across  disciplines, thanks to my comprehensive curriculum in Computer Science,  Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Physics. These diverse areas of study have equipped me with the skills to approach problems from different perspectives. My exploratory projects, such as designing a language framework for  typesetting systems and proposing an augmented type system for  JavaScript, alongside projects in operating systems and AI, like  building a mini kernel and an AI-based storyteller, have deepened my  interests and prepared me with the necessary skill set. With a strong interest in further advancing the field of programming  languages, I am applying for graduate study to pursue my academic and  research goals. 



During my undergraduate years, a comprehensive curriculum provided me with  both a broad academic foundation and advanced coursework in programming  languages, compilers, and systems. In Programming Language Design (CS 422), I created languages in different paradigms using the K framework. In Compiler Construction (CS 426), I developed a functional KOOL compiler, and in Operating System Design (CS 423), I built several practical  Linux kernel modules. These projects provided me with a strong understanding of language design, compiler construction, and operating systems. Furthermore, my coursework in Digital Systems (ECE 385) and Computational Physics  (PHYS 498) strengthened my analytical and hardware-level thinking,  complementing my perspective on systems and computation. Together, these courses have equipped me with the theoretical foundation and  practical skills necessary to pursue innovative research in programming  languages and compilers. 



Building on the foundational knowledge from my coursework in programming  languages and compilers, I began an exploratory project to address  challenges I encountered with LaTeX during technical writing. The idea of creating a typesetting system to replace LaTeX emerged from my  frustration with its poor readability and limited flexibility when  writing complex ODE formulas, big-step semantics, and TikZ graphs. Lines of dense macros made source files unreadable, while simple adjustments, like spacing, often required opaque “black magic.” 



To address these issues, I began designing a new language that improves LaTeX's readability and expandability. I studied The TeXbook and LuaTeX documentation. It introduces some effective typesetting concepts like TeX's Glue-Box  model but relies on an outdated macro system and lacks modern Unicode  support. Based on these insights, I designed a Lisp-like domain-specific language,  which allows user-defined syntax and semantics to capture frequent  constructs, such as those in ODE formulas or big-step semantics. This could fold cumbersome expressions into human-readable syntax, making the language significantly more readable and usable. I also prototyped an IR that generates instructions for rendering in browsers or PDFs according to OpenType font specification. While the project is still preliminary, it has strengthened my understanding  of modular language design and broadened my perspective on translating  high-level constructs into graphical outputs. 



Beyond the typesetting project, I also explored language design through a  proposal to address limitations I observed in TypeScript, a typed  superset of JavaScript that I frequently use in web programming. While its subtyping system shows promise for refined typing that could better capture the behavior of JavaScript APIs, the lack of type operations  often leads to convoluted "type gymnastics" or manual workarounds,  undermining its expressiveness. 



To address these limitations, I proposed a predicate-based type system,  where compile-time predicate functions could be used to evaluate type  constraints based on metadata of checked variables. Specific type operations could be implemented in predicate functions, while  commonly used types are treated as syntactic sugar, enhancing the  language's flexibility and usability. It also unifies imperative paradigms with type checking, where TypeScript's system is often inconsistent. The proposal deepened my understanding of predicate-based systems and its application in  practical type system design. 



In addition to my major projects, I have worked on several smaller projects that further developed my technical skills. I have built an AI-based interactive storyteller that generates story pieces based on user prompts. In a course project, I implemented a mini kernel for x86 architecture,  which deepened my understanding of operating systems and low-level  programming. Additionally, I reconstructed the Nintendo NES console on FPGA as part of a digital  systems course, applying hardware design principles to a real-world  system. These projects complemented my academic and research preparation by  broadening my perspective in areas in hardware, systems, and AI. 



My coursework and projects have deepened my interest in programming  languages and compilers, leading me to seek opportunities at UIUC to  collaborate with experts in the field and contribute to its vibrant  research environment. I am particularly interested in creating augmented type systems for  practical programming languages, using verification techniques to  enhance security and maintainability in software and systems. Additionally, I want to explore universal compiler generators and domain-specific  language design, and simplify the language creation process while  preserving performance. UIUC's strong curriculum and collaborative research environment make it the ideal place to pursue these goals. 



As an undergraduate student who apply to graduate school, my experience of UIUC's strong curriculum and its research groups shows that it will be  the ideal place for me to pursue my goals in programming languages and  compilers. I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work with Professor  Talia Ringer, whose work on formal verification aligns with my interest  in developing augmented type systems to enhance software correctness. Professor Lingming Zhang's research in program analysis and testing resonates  with my goal of ensuring reliability and maintainability in practical  systems. Professor Vikram Adve's contributions to compiler infrastructure, such as the  LLVM project, directly inspire my interest in building universal  compiler generators that balance performance and flexibility. I also admire Professor Darko Marinov's work in software testing and  Professor Tianyin Xu's research on systems reliability, which bridges  programming languages and operating systems, complementing my interest  in designing verifiable and robust tools. The combination of UIUC's exceptional faculty and research-driven  environment will provide the perfect foundation to advance my research  interests and contribute to the field.
