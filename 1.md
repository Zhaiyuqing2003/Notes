#### Question 1: Particle motion in 1D

>A particle moves along the $x$ direction under the influence of a force $F = F(v, t)$ that varies with both time and velocity given by
>$$
>F(v, t) = -ktv^2
>$$
>where $k > 0$ is a constant

##### (a)

> At initial time $t = 0$ the particle is located at $x(t = 0) = v_0$. Determine the particle's velocity $v(t)$ at a later time.

Set up the equation:
$$
F = m \derit v = 
$$


##### (b)

>How much time, $t_f$, does it take the particle to stop?

##### (c)

>Determine the distance $x_f = x(t_f)$ at which the particles stops. You may leave the final expression in the form of an integral.
