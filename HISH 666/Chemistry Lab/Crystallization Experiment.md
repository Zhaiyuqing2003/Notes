# Crystallization Experiment

## Introduction

This research intended to make different kinds of beautiful crystals from the crystallization of some common salts. (The most common crystal is the blue crystal of $\ce{CuSO4}$.

Those crystals could be used as decorations and has certain aesthetic values. That's the main motivation of this research.

There are few problems that need to addressed in this research. First one is the impurities mixed in the salt solution during the crystallization process, which will cause the formation of irregular crystals. The second problem only happens when cooling the oversaturated solution. Inappropriate cooling time and the amount of oversaturated salt will also cause formation of irregular crystals.

## Research Design

We intended to make the crystals for 

* Red: $\ce{KSCN, K2Cr2O7}$
* Orange: $\ce{K2Cr2O7}$
* Yellow: $\ce{K2CrO4, K4Fe(CN)6, Fe^{3+} salt}$
* Green: $\ce{FeCl2 * 4H2O, CuCl2 * 2H2O}$
* Teal: $\ce{FeSO4, (NH4)2Fe(SO4)2 * 6H2O}$
* Blue: $\ce{CuSO4 *5H2O}$
* Purple: $\ce{KCrSO4, KMnO4, Crystallized Purple}$
* Pink: $\ce{MnSO4}$

The $\ce{K2Cr2O7}$ is toxic and regulated by government. So, it might be replaced by other salts.

There two methods for crystallization. 

For the first method, it only requires making saturated solution room temperature, and waiting for the salt to crystalize as the water evaporates. 

For the second method, it requires making saturated solution at high temperature. Then, as the solution cool, the salt will crystallize.

The first method is significant slower, and will usually take about 2 - 3 weeks, in comparison, the second method only takes about 30 - 60 minutes, but it's harder to control the formation of the crystals, and it's also more dangerous, for some salt might release some toxic substance at high temperature. 

## Procedure

### Materials

Beakers, Glass Rods, Distilled Water, Plate, Thermostat Water Bath Cauldron, Thermometer, Funnel, Evaporating Dish, Graduated Cylinder, Electronic Balance, Weighing Paper, 

#### First method

1. Use graduated cylinder (with 10 ml accuracy) to get 100 ml distilled water, move the distilled water into an appropriate size beaker, use glass rods to direct the water if needed. 

2. Use the thermometer to test the room temperature, and the find the corresponding solubility (in gram / 100ml) of the salt on the solubility table. Use the electronic balance to weigh the intended mass of the salt for 100 ml water.

3. Mixed the salt with the distilled water, use glass rods to stir the solution until the salt is completely dissolved.

4. Transfer the solution in evaporating dish, put the dish into a place with least dust as possible. Wait for few days (this depends on kind of salt) until some crystals appears. Collect the small crystal with funnel. 

5. Do Step 1 - 2 again, and put the small crystals in the saturated solution. The small crystals will go bigger, repeat this step until the crystal grows to desired size.

#### Second method

1. Follow the same step 1 - 2 in first method, except with respect to a temperature that is higher (usually 20 - 40 $\ce{^\circ C}$, depend on type of salt) than room temperature.
2. Mix the salt with the solution, put the beater into Water Bath Cauldron, set it to the temperature that is decided in Step 1. Use the thermometer to detect the temperature of the solution, and wait till the solution reach the desired temperature. Then, stirring the solution until all the salt is completely dissolved. 
3. Slowly decrease the temperature of the water bath cauldron. The salt will slowly crystallize, pick the small crystals form in this process with funnel. 
4. Either use the Step 5 in the first method or repeat the Step 1 - 2 in second method with the small crystals in the solution to continue increase the size of the crystal.

## Budget

We need budget for the salts (1 standard size bottle for each), and Thermostat Water Bath Cauldron (or we could borrow it from main school), few clean Evaporating Dish (current evaporating dish is not clean enough for crystallization).Q
