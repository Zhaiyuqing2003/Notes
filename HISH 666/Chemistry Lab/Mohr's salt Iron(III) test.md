# 1

Use strong acid, strong base, or electrolysis. $\ce{Na2CO3}$

# 2

$$
\ce{Fe(s) + H_2SO4(aq) -> H2(g) + FeSO4(aq)}
$$

$$
\ce{Fe2O3(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> Fe2(SO4)3(aq) + 3H2O(l)}
$$

$$
\ce{Fe3O4(s) + 4H2SO4(aq) -> FeSO4(aq) + Fe2(SO4)3(aq) + 4H2O(l)}
$$

Yes, it will form unwanted $\ce{Fe2(SO4)3}$. The rust could be removed using the method in question 1. 

# 3

Keeping the pH = 1 could make sure that the $\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ could not be oxidized.

# 4

Make sure that the solution won't dry out, and maintain the pH of the solution approximately to 1.

# 5

Because when the solution is dried out, the crystal will form on the bottom, and it's hard to transfer the solid into a beaker. Also, because the mohr's salt are hydrate, when drying out the liquid, the mohr's salt will be dehydrated, which is not appropriate. Moreover, the original $\ce{(NH4)2SO4}$ might have some remnant, and when crystallized, it might mixed into the mohr's salt.

# 6

Use the ethanol to wash the mohr's salt, for it will not dissolve in ethanol.
