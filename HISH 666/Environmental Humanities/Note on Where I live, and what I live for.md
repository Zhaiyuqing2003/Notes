Notes on [Where I lived, and What I Lived For](C:\Users\zhai\OneDrive - 北京大学附属中学\SCHOOL\Senior 3\Environmental Humanities\Where I lived, and What I Lived For.pdf)

The author like the NATURE.

He thought that the NATURE is more important.

He thought that he is "rich", mentally rich, because he own the "NATURE".

Not fancy things, (poems), but reality.

It's important to live free and uncommitted, the social status or related thing is not important.

Not crowded. Away from noise and disturbance.

NATURE feeds him.

Nature Rather than Human Made life --> Feel Morning, the vitality, and make people awake. and thus alive.

To be awake --> to be alive. 

Nature is simple, but human made life are too much paltry information and things. ---> Consciousness ---> Awake and awareness --> To be alive.

Nature --> Essential facts of life. <-- pure life

To feel the pure life, to have thought over it, rather than deceive your self, and believe in some "gods".

Simplicity Fucking Simplicity. 

Simplify. And not fast, not so many.

Sleep <---> Awake

Sleep ---> Distract by others. 

Because people are driven by greedy and anxiety, doing things that are not necessary.

e. g. Newspaper Distract

Just be simple.

Don't be limited by norms, moral, poetry, religions, opinions, and all the forms from the society.

People cannot face the reality, cannot see through the surface.

The truth is not remote, and the reality will reveal one you really think about the things in front of you.

Live in the fucking present.

Get rid of the noisy, fast things from society.

True life with reality or death.
