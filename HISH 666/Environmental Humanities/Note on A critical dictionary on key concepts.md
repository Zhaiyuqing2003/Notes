The **Environment** and **Nature** and **Landscape** is **not synonymous**. 

**Environment** is more *functional* (to aesthetic landscape) and *inorganic* (to nature).

Environment --> difference between races and nations. 

**Environmentalism** -> environmental determinism

> ... Questioned the environment’s power to shape human destiny and instead argued that the power lay with humans to use the resources offered by the environment in fulfilling that destiny.

**Environmental Determinism** <---> **Social Determinism**

>... of falling into the opposite trap of social determinism by denying any power to environmental processes.

**Social Constructionism** 

If Environment <--> Social Construction,

Environment Problem exists ? Mere Imagination. --> No protection

Instead, Social Construction <-- Explain -- Environment. (Shown more about our thoughts on environment)

Problems do exist.

**Environmental** 

> but as a qualifier, an arbiter of degree rather than of essence.
>
> It's unclear, difficult to define. free for all.

Some kind of redefining.

"Light green policies" <---> "Environmentalism"

Reformist, incremental, insubstantial thinking.?"

"Dark green policies" <---> "Ecologism"

Radical restructuring. 

Unclear definition --> Misuse, widely used, yet not reliable. 

>The contestation of environmental meanings is therefore shot through with political and economic contingency, and increasingly with fears about technology and control. 

Early stage of environmentalism  --> Business as enemy

After "Wise Use" & "greenhouse effect"

Business <--> Environment NGOs. (Argues)

Environmentalism <---> Anti-globalization

​	Consumption <---> Environmental Damage.

Increasing scales --> distancing people from "environmental issues"

e.g. <-- ozone

Ethics, actions --differ in--> global/local environments

Ethics <-- Emphasize.

Connection <---> Increase awareness --> environmental sustainability. 

Environmental education --> Decision making, implementing policies involved with citizens.

Environment --> Citizens internalized.

The politician don't  know which policy to make, because they don't even  know what  environment is. 

Cultural politics of the environment <-- how policy made, how each group support their argument. 

The contesting over the definition of the environment happens  everywhere.



Environment -20th-> surroundings --21st-> Complicated concept.

entangle with "nature" and "landscape" 

Not purely environmental, as it deal with the connection somewhat socially. 

The concepts needs to be state clearly. 

It affects all  ideologies, and individual attitudes & global construction. It  serves all.
