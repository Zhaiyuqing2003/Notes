# Chemical Equilibrium

> Chemical Equilibrium is *the state where the ==concentration== of all reactants and products remain ==constant== with time*. ==Equilibrium== is not static but is a highly ==dynamic== situation.(page 511). The concentration of reactants never go to $0$.

## The equilibrium condition

When **The forward rate = the reverse rate**.

As the reaction goes to the right, the concentration of reactant will increase, and the concentration of product will decrease. So does the reaction rate of forward and reverse action, which will eventually become equal.

## The equilibrium constant

In a reaction $\ce{jA + kB <=> lC + mD}$. The equilibrium constant is:
$$
K = \frac{[C]^l[D]^m}{[A]^j[B]^k}
$$
It has **no units**.

It has some properties:

1. the equilibrium constant for reverse reaction is the reciprocal of the the forward reaction.

$$
K_{reverse} = \frac{1}{K_{forward}}
$$

2. the equilibrium constant will take $n$ exponents if the original equation is multiplied by $n$.

$$
\ce{njA + nkB <=> nlC + nmD}
$$

$$
K' = \frac{[C]^{ln}[D]^{lm}}{[A]^{lj}[B]^{lk}} = K^n
$$

The equilibrium constant **is same for same temperature, regardless the initial concentration.** 

Each set of equilibrium concentration is called an **equilibrium position.** Equilibrium position might change, but there are only one equilibrium constant in certain temperature.

## Equilibrium expression involving pressures

The equilibrium constant could be also expressed in **partial pressure** for ideal gas. For the reaction: $\ce{jA + kB <=> lC + mD}$
$$
K_{p} = \frac{(P_{C})^l(P_{D})^m}{(P_{A})^j(P_{B})^k}
$$
which have the relationship with $K$:
$$
K_p = K(RT)^{\Delta{n}} \qquad where \qquad \Delta{n} = (l+m)-(j+k)
$$
by ideal gas law:
$$
PV = nRT \qquad or \qquad P = (\frac{n}{V})RT = CRT
$$

## Heterogeneous equilibria

**Homogeneous equilibria**: all the reactants/products are in gas phase.

**Heterogeneous equilibria**: not all the reactants/products are in gas phase. They may in other phases.

>the position of a heterogeneous equilibrium **does not depend on the amounts of pure solids or liquids present**. (Because the concentration of them cannot change). T**heir concentrations are not included** in the equilibrium expression for the reaction.

## Application of the Equilibrium Constant

If $K > 1$ the reaction at equilibrium mostly consist of products.

If $K < 1$, the reaction at equilibrium mostly consist of reactants.

**Size of K and the time to reach equilibrium is not directly related.**

### Reaction Quotient

For the reaction: $\ce{jA + kB <=> lC + mD}$
$$
Q = \frac{[C]_0^l[D]_0^m}{[A]_0^j[B]_0^k}
$$
The formula uses initial condition instead of equilibrium condition.

**If $\bold{Q =K}$, the system is at equilibrium**

**If $\bold{Q < K}$, the system is shift to right.**

**If $\bold{Q > K}$, the system is shift to left.**

## Solving Equilibrium Problems

1. Write the balanced equation.
2. Write the expression for $K$.
3. List initial concentrations.
4. Calculate $Q$. Determine the shits to equilibrium.
5. List changes to reach equilibrium, and get equilibrium concentrations.
6. Substitute the equilibrium concentration into $K$, and solve the unknown.
7. Double check the result.

For the reaction with negligible $K$. The reaction could be simplified by considering $K$ as $0$.

## Le Chatelier's Principle

>If a change is imposed on a system at equilibrium, **the position of the equilibrium will shift in a direction that tends to reduce that change.**

1. if **a component is added** to a reaction system at equilibrium, **the equilibrium position will shift** in the direction that **lowers the concentration of that component.** If a component is removed, the opposite effect occurs.
2. The addition of **inert gas** or **catalysts** have no effects on the concentration / pressure of reactants / products, as well as the equilibrium position.
3. When **Volume** is increase or **Pressure** decrease, the system reduced its own volume / increase its own pressure by favoring the side with **less number of molecules** (Applied to gas)
4. When **Temperature** increase, the **K** changes directly, and thus tries to decrease by favoring the endothermic reaction in the forward / reverse reaction.
