At room temperature, $\ce{pH}$ of 0.10M acetic acid solution $\ce{a}$, which measure can make $\ce{pH = (a + 1)}$

1. Adding water to 10 times volumes as the original one.

  This will not work, because adding water to times reduce the $\ce{[H+]}$ to $\ce{1/10}$ at first, but according to La Ch√¢telier theorem, the reaction will goes the side with more molecules (forward), and increase $\ce{[H+]}$, so the resulting will be larger than $\ce{1/10[H+]0}$, which couldn't make the $\ce{pH = (a + 1)}$

  $$
  \ce{[CH3COOH] = 0.010 M}
  $$

  $$
  \ce{K_a = \frac{[CH3COO-][H+]}{[CH3COOH]} = \frac{x^2}{0.010 - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.010} = 1.8 * 10^{-5}}
  $$

  $$
  \ce{x = \sqrt{0.010 * 1.8 * 10^{-5}} = 4.2 * 10^{-4} M}
  $$

  $$
  \ce{\frac{x}{[CH3COOH]0} < 5\%}
  $$

  $$
  \ce{[H+] = x = 4.2 * 10^{-4} M}
  $$

2. **Add sodium acetic solid**

	Adding the $\ce{CH3COONa}$ will increase the $\ce{CH3COO-}$ in the solution, and push reaction backward. Thus, thus the $\ce{H+}$ could be reduced. 

$$
\ce{K_a = \frac{[H+][CH3COO-]}{[CH3COOH]} = \frac{x^2}{0.10 - x} \approx \frac{x^2}{0.10} = 1.8 * 10^{-5}}
$$

$$
\ce{
	[H+]1 = x = \sqrt{0.10 * 1.8 * 10^{-5}} = 1.3 * 10^{-3} 
}
$$


$$
\ce{[H+]2 = 1/10 [H+]1 = 1.3 * 10^{-4} M}
$$

$$
\ce{K_a = \frac{[H+]2[CH3COO-]2}{[CH3COOH]2} = \frac{1/10x * (1/10x + y)}{0.10 - 1/10x} = 1.8 * 10^{-5}}
$$

$$
\ce{
	y = 0.013 M
}
$$

3. Add equal volume of $\ce{0.20 M HCl}$ solution.

	Adding the $\ce{HCl}$ will only increase the $\ce{[H+]}$, which couldn't reduce the $\ce{pH}$.
	$$
	\ce{
		[H+] = [HCl] = 0.20M 
	}
	$$

	$$
	\ce{
		K_a = \frac{[H+][CH3COO-]}{[CH3COOH]} = \frac{(0.20 + x)*x}{0.10 - x} \approx \frac{0.20 * x}{0.10} = 1.8 * 10^{-5}
	}
	$$

	$$
	\ce{x = 9.0 * 10^{-6} M}
	$$

	$$
	\ce{\frac{x}{[CH3COOH]0} < 5\%}
	$$

	$$
	\ce{[H+] = x + [H+]0 = 9.0 * 10^{-6} + 0.20 = 0.20 M}
	$$

4. Raise the temperature

	Dissociation is a endothermic process, raising temperature will only increase $\ce{[H+]}$.
