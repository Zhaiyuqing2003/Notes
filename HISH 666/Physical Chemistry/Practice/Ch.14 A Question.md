1. The reason that acetic acid does not conduct electric at $O$ point is **because that the acetic acid is not dissolved, so there is no ions that could freely passed the electrons**.

2. The concentration of hydronium ions of point $a, b, c$ arranging in increasing order is $b, a, c$ 

3. The greatest percent dissociation of point $a, b, c$ is $c$

4. Which disturbance will increase this concentration of $\ce{CH3COO-}$ at $c$ point. 
	1. **Raising the temperature (dissociation is an endothermic reaction).**
	2. Adding $\ce{NaOH}$ dilution solution.
	3. **Adding $\ce{\bold{KOH}}$ solid.**
	4. Adding water.
	5. **Adding $\ce{\bold{CH3COONa}}$ solid.**
	6. **Adding Zinc.**

5. In the dilution process, which remains increasing:

	1. $\ce{[H+]}$
	2. $\ce{\bold{n_{H^+}}}$
	3. $\ce{N_{CH3COOH}}$
	4. $\ce{\bold{\frac{[H+]}{[CH3COOH]}}}$

	**b** and **d**
