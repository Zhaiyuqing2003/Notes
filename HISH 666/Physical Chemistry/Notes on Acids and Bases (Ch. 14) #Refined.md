# Acids and Bases

## Definition

**Arrhenius Definition:**

* acids produce hydrogen ions $\ce{H+}$ ions
* bases produce hydroxide ions $\ce{OH-}$ ions.

**Bronsted-Lowry Definition:**

* Acids are proton donor.
* Bases are proton acceptor

## Acid

### Acid Dissociation 

$$
\begin{array}{lfl}
\ce{&  HA(aq) & + & H_2O(l) & <=> & H3O+(aq)       & + & A-(aq)} \\
\ce{&  Acid   &   & Base    &     & Conjugate Acid &   & Conjugate Base }
\end{array}
$$

It's called **Ionization**.

$\ce{H3O+}$ is called **Hydronium Ion**

#### Conjugate acid-base pair: 

There are two conjugate acid-base pair.

* Acid ($\ce{HA}$) & Conjugate Base ($\ce{A-}$)
* Base ($\ce{H2O}$) & Conjugate Acid ($\ce{H3O+}$)

#### Acid Dissociation Constant:

The Equilibrium Constant from **Acid Dissociation**.
$$
\ce{K_a = \frac{[H3O+][A-]}{[HA]} = \frac{[H+][A-]}{[HA]}}
$$



### Acid Classification

#### Strong Acid

* The dissociation equilibrium lies far to the right.
* The $\ce{K_a}$ is large (Too large so that it's **unmeasurable**)
* Yield **Weak Conjugate Base** (Which is weaker than water, so that water will grab the hydrogen ion away).

##### Examples

$$
\begin{array}{r|l}
	\text{Name} & \ce{Symbol} \\ \hline
	\text{Sulfuric acid} & \ce{H2SO4} \\
	\text{Hydrochloric acid} & \ce{HCl} \\
	\text{Hydrobromic acid} & \ce{HBr} \\
	\text{Hydroiodic acid} & \ce{HI} \\
	\text{Perchloric acid} & \ce{HClO4} \\
	\text{Nitric Acid} & \ce{HNO3} \\
\end{array}
$$

#### Weak Acid

* The dissociation equilibrium lies far to the left.
* The $\ce{K_a}$ is small, and used to present the **acid strength**.
* Yield **Strong Conjugate Base** (Which is stronger than water, so that it's hard for water to grab the hydrogen ion)

##### Examples & $\ce{\bold{K_a}}$ table

See tables.

#### Other Categorizations

Monoprotic Acid: acid having one acidic proton.

Diprotic Acid: acid having two acidic protons.

Polyprotic Acid: acid having multiple acidic protons.

Oxyacid: the acidic proton is attached to an oxygen atom.

Organic Acid: Acid with a carbon atom backbone (commonly **carboxyl group** $\ce{RCOOH}$)

#### Amphoteric substance & Autoionization

**Amphoteric substance** could behave either as an acid or as a base.

Water is amphoteric substance, water autoionized at $T = 25^\circ C$
$$
\ce{2H2O(l) <=> H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq)}
$$

$$
\ce{H2O(l) <=> H+(aq) + OH-(aq)}
$$

$$
\ce{[H+] = [OH-] = 1.0* 10^{-7}M}
$$

We define that $\ce{K_w}$ as equilibrium constant of the autoionization:
$$
\ce{K_w = \frac{[H+][OH-]}{[H2O]} = [H+][OH-] = 1.0*10^{-14}}
$$

## Bases

### Base Dissociation 

$$
\begin{array}{lfl}
\ce{&B(aq)& + &H2O(l)& <=> &BH+(aq)& + &OH-(aq)} \\
\ce{&Base && Acid && Conjugate acid && Conjugate base}
\end{array}
$$

It's called **Ionization**.

$\ce{OH-}$ is called **Hydroxide Ion**

#### Conjugate acid-base pair: 

There are two conjugate acid-base pair.

* Base ($\ce{B}$) & Conjugate Acid($\ce{BH+}$)
* Acid ($\ce{H2O}$) & Conjugate Base ($\ce{OH-}$)

#### Acid Dissociation Constant:

The Equilibrium Constant from **Base Dissociation**.
$$
\ce{K_b = \frac{[OH-][BH+]}{[B]}}
$$

### Strong Base

* The dissociation equilibrium lies far to the right.
* The $\ce{K_b}$ is large (Too large so that it's **unmeasurable**)
* Yield **Weak Conjugate Acid** (Which is weaker than water, so that water will give the hydrogen ion away).

#### Examples

$$
\ce{
    \begin{array}{r|l}
    	Name				& Symbol \\ \hline
		Lithium Hydroxide 	& LiOH \\
		Sodium Hydroxide	& NaOH \\
		Potassium Hydroxide & KOH \\
		Rubidum Hydroxide	& RbOH \\
		Cesium Hydroxide	& CsOH \\ \hline
		Calcium Hydroxide	& Ca(OH)2 \\
		Barium Hydroxide	& Ba(OH)2 \\
		Strontium Hydroxide & Sr(OH)2
    \end{array}
}
$$

### Weak Base

* The dissociation equilibrium lies far to the left.
* The $\ce{K_a}$ is small, and used to present the **acid strength**.
* Yield **Strong Conjugate Base** (Which is stronger than water, so that it's hard for water to grab the hydrogen ion)

#### Examples & $\ce{\bold{K_b}}$ table

See tables.

## Salt

Salt consist of **Anions** and **Cations**

### Anions

For Anions like $\ce{A-}$

#### Strong Acid Anions (1)

They are **Weak Conjugate Base**. 

They couldn't reduce $\ce{H+}$ by forming $\ce{HA}$

No effect on the $\ce{pH}$.

#### Weak Acid Anions (2)

They are **Strong Conjugate Base**.

They could undergo:
$$
\ce{A-(aq) + H+(aq) <=> HA(aq)}
$$
and reduce $\ce{H+}$,

Making solution basic.

### Cations

#### Strong Base Cations (3)

They are **Weak Conjugate Acid**.

They couldn't release $\ce{H+}$.

No change on the $\ce{pH}$

#### Weak Base Cations (4)

They are **Strong Conjugate Acid**.

They could release $\ce{H+}$, 
$$
\ce{HB+(aq) <=> H+(aq) + B(aq)}
$$
Making the solution basic.

#### Highly Charged Metal Ions (5)

They could release $\ce{H+}$
$$
\ce{HM^{n+}(aq) <=> M^{(n-1)+}(aq) + H+(aq)}
$$
Making the solution basic.

### Different Situations

| Type      | Acidity |
| --------- | ------- |
| (1) + (3) | Neutral |
| (2) + (3) | Basic   |
| (1) + (4) | Acidic  |
| (2) + (4) | Depends |
| (5)       | Acidic  |

$$
\ce{
	\begin{align}
		K_a > K_b &\quad Acidic \\
		K_a < K_b &\quad basic	\\
		K_a = K_b &\quad Neutral
	\end{align}
}
$$

## Miscellaneous

### The pH / pOH Scale

$$
\ce{pH = -log[H+]}
$$

$$
\ce{[H+] = 10^{-pH}}
$$

â€‹	It follows the significant place calculation rules:
$$
\ce{DP(pH) = SD([H+])}
$$

$$
\ce{pOH = -log(\frac{K_w}{[H+]}) = -log(K_w) - pH = 14 - pH (at 25^\circ C)}
$$

### Dissociation Constant Relationships

For an acid HA. 
$$
\ce{HA(aq) <=> A-(aq) + H+(aq)}
$$
And its conjugate base
$$
\ce{A-(aq) + H2O(l) <=> HA(aq) + OH-(aq)}
$$

$$
\ce{K_a = \frac{[H+][A-]}{[HA]}} \\
\ce{K_b = \frac{[HA][OH-]}{[A-]}} \\
$$

$$
\ce{K_a * K_b = \frac{[H+][A-][HA][OH-]}{[HA][A-]} = [H+][OH-] = K_w}
$$

### Percent Dissociation

$$
\ce{Percent dissociation = \frac{amount dissociated}{initial concentration} * 100\%}
$$

According to **La Chatelier's theorem**, when the solution become more diluted, the equilibrium will favor right, and increase the percent dissociation. 

### Major Groups

The major substance presented in the solution.

### Acid Strength Reason

(1) Bond Energy $\uparrow$, Acid Strength $\downarrow$ (More likely to dissociate)

(2) Polarity $\uparrow$, Acid Strength $\uparrow$ (More likely $\ce{H+}$  deprived by $\ce{H2O}$)

#### H - X 

| H-X Bond    | Bond Energy | Polarity | Acid Strength |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------- | ------------- |
| $\ce{H-F}$  | 565         | Highest  | Weak          |
| $\ce{H-Cl}$ | 427         | High     | Strong        |
| $\ce{H-Br}$ | 363         | Low      | Strong        |
| $\ce{H-I}$  | 295         | Lowest   | Strong        |

Through Group, Bond Energy $\downarrow$, Polarity $\downarrow$, bond energy have more effects on acid strength.

#### H - O - X

| Oxyacid      | $\bold{K_a}$         |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| $\ce{HClO4}$ | Large                |
| $\ce{HClO3}$ | $\ce{1}$             |
| $\ce{HClO2}$ | $\ce{1.2 * 10^{-2}}$ |
| $\ce{HClO}$ | $\ce{3.5 * 10^{-8}}$ |
| $\ce{H2SO4}$ | Large |
| $\ce{H2SO3}$ | $\ce{1.5 * 10^{-2}}$ |
| $\ce{HNO3}$ | Large |
| $\ce{HNO2}$ | $\ce{4.0 * 10^{-4}}$ |

As more oxygen attached, the $\ce{X}$ will tend to be more positively charged, which could in turn form a stronger bond between the oxygen which tied to the hydrogen, thus reduce the bond energy of $\ce{H-O}$, since it's the $\ce{O}$ less need the $\ce{H}$. 

Also, as more oxygen attached, the $\ce{X}$ will tend to be more positively charged, which could attract the electrons to the $\ce{O}$ side, which leads to a greater polarity between $\ce{O-H}$.

So, as more oxygen attached, the bond energy will decrease, and polarity will increase, resulting in greater acidity. 

| Acid         | X          | Electronegativity | $K_a$                   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| $\ce{HOCl}$  | $\ce{Cl}$  | 3.0               | $\ce{4 * 10^{-8}}$      |
| $\ce{HOBr}$  | $\ce{Br}$  | 2.8               | $\ce{2 * 10^{-9}}$      |
| $\ce{HOI}$   | $\ce{I}$   | 2.5               | $\ce{2 * 10^{-11}}$     |
| $\ce{HOCH3}$ | $\ce{CH3}$ | 2.3               | $\ce{\approx 10^{-15}}$ |

For the elements $\ce{X}$, greater the electronegativity is, the greater the $\ce{K_a}$, because the greater electronegativity will cause the pull the electron to the oxygen side, and in turn increase the polarity and acid strength.

### Oxides

Oxide looks like: $\ce{X_aO_b}$. 

When dissolve in the water, if $\ce{O-X}$ breaks, it's **basic oxides**. For example:
$$
\begin{align}
\ce{CaO(s) + H2O(l) &-> Ca(OH)2(aq)} \\
\ce{K_2O(s) + H2O(l) &-> 2KOH(aq)} \\
\end{align}
$$
Because the $\ce{O-X}$ first break, and then
$$
\ce{O^{2-}(aq) + H2O(l) -> 2OH-(aq)}
$$
If the $\ce{O-X}$ doesn't break, it's **acidic oxides**, for example:
$$
\ce{
	\begin{align}
		SO3(g) + H2O(l) &-> H2SO4(aq) \\
		SO2(g) + H2O(l) &-> H2SO3(aq) \\
		CO2(g) + H2O(l) &-> H2CO3(aq) \\
		2NO2(g) + H2O(l) &-> HNO3(aq) + HNO2(aq)
	\end{align}
}
$$
