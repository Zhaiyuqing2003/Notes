**Statement of the Problem**:

In an academic setting, consistent and reliable Wi-Fi connectivity is  crucial for students and faculty alike to access online resources and  maintain effective communication. This project will undertake a detailed analysis of Wi-Fi signal strength and network performance across  various buildings within the Grainger College of Engineering at the  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. By mapping out signal  strengths and analyzing internet speeds at different locations and  times, we aim to identify any areas of weak coverage and understand the  relationship between signal strength and network performance. This  effort is intended to provide a practical overview of the current state  of Wi-Fi connectivity on campus, pinpointing areas for potential  improvement and offering insights into the effectiveness of the existing network infrastructure.

**Methods**:

Our approach involves the utilization of network analysis tools such as Wireshark and WiFi Analyzer apps to measure signal strength and internet speed across predetermined locations within selected buildings, including Siebel, ECEB, CSL, Grainger Library, Engineering Hall, and DCL. These measurements will be conducted at different times of the day (morning, noon, and evening) to account for variability in network usage and performance.

The data collected will enable us to:

1. Generate Wi-Fi coverage maps for individual Access Points (APs) and aggregate coverage across the campus, using distinct colors to differentiate APs.
2. Establish a correlation between Wi-Fi signal strength and internet speed to gauge network performance.
3. Explore the feasibility of developing a location-detection algorithm using the "three-point" method (triangulation), based on signal strength from multiple APs.

**Plan and Schedule**:

**Phase 1: Preparation and Preliminary Data Collection** (April 8 - April 15)

- Select and familiarize with necessary software tools.
- Finalize the list of buildings and specific locations for data collection.
- Conduct preliminary data collection in one building to refine methodology.

**Phase 2: Extensive Data Collection** (April 16 - April 25)

- Systematically collect data across the chosen locations at different times.
- Begin preliminary analysis to ensure data quality and consistency.

**Phase 3: Data Analysis and Coverage Map Creation** (April 26 - April 29)

- Analyze the collected data to determine Wi-Fi coverage and performance.
- Start creating Wi-Fi coverage maps and performing correlation analysis between signal strength and internet speed.

**Phase 4: Final Analysis and Report Preparation** (April 30 - May 1)

- Finalize the Wi-Fi coverage maps and correlation analysis.
- If time and data permit, develop and test the preliminary location-detection algorithm.
- Compile findings and analyses into the final report.

**Phase 5: Submission** (May 2)

- Review, finalize, and submit the final report.

This schedule ensures ample time for data collection, analysis, and report preparation, aiming for a comprehensive understanding and presentation of Wi-Fi coverage and performance within the Grainger College of Engineering.

**Deliverables**:

- Wi-Fi coverage maps for individual APs and the entire Wi-Fi network across selected buildings.
- Analysis report detailing the correlation between signal strength and internet speed.
- Preliminary location-detection algorithm based on Wi-Fi signal strength, contingent upon data sufficiency and project timeline adherence.
