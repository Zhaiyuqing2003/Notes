**Investigation of the accuracy of arduino built-in time function**



Arduino is a type of microcontroller that could be used for experiment data collection. One frequently used built-in function is the micros() function that measures the time in microseconds since the program starts. This report will investigate the accuracy of the arduino built-in micros() function, and how accurately we could synchronize the internal time of multiple arduino boards.



**Hardware Design**



The Arduino Mega 2560 and Adafruit GPS breakout board is used. The GPS breakout, when connected to the
