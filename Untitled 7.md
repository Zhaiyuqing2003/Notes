The idea of creating a typesetting system to replace LaTeX emerged from my experience writing complex ODE formulas, big-step semantics, and intricate TikZ graphs. Writing lines upon lines macros resulted in a complete loss of readability, and even adjusting simple features like text spacing sometimes resulted in macro "black magics". 

Having this in mind, I tried to create a new language that improves LaTeX's readability and expandability.  To understand existing system, I studied "The TeXbook", and LuaTeX documentation. TeX introduces a flexible Glue-Box model for typesetting, yet its macro system outdated by today's standards. This macro system, while theoretically powerful, introduces many opaque mechanisms and fails to deliver the needed expandability. It also lacks support of modern Unicode fonts, which later augmentations provided by LuaTeX address partially the problems. 

Understanding these limitations, I have created a Lisp-like domain-specific language which allows user-defined syntax and semantics. It allows user to define scenario-specific syntax and semantics that could capture patterns and constructs in ODE formulas or big-step semantics. I have also designed an prototype IR that is passed to back end, where it will generates graphic instruction according to OpenType font specifications for rendering in different environment like browser and PDF. Although the project is not finished, it have deepened my understanding of design of modular language and macro systems. I also gained experience in translating high-level constructs into graphical outputs, which is different from traditional compilers that targets assembly code.
