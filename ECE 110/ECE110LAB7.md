##### Problem 1

When there is light, the $V_1$ will decrease and $V_2$ will increase. $V_1$ and $V_2$ always add up to the voltage of the battery (roughly). The transistor roughly acts as a variable resistor since there is light, its resistance will increase (reflected as the increase in the $V_2$). 

##### Problem 2

$$
V_2 = 0.06V, V_1 = 8.70V
$$

the $R_{\text{DS}}^{\text{(dark)}} = \frac {0.06\V}{8.70\V} \cdot 1 \text{k}\ohm = 0.00690\text{k} \ohm$

##### Problem 3

$$
V_2 = 8.55\V, V_1 =0.06\V
$$

the $R_{\text{DS}}^{\text{(light)}} = \frac {8.55\V}{0.06\V} \cdot 1 \text{k}\ohm = 142.5 \text{k}\ohm $
