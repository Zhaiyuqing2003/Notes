##### Problem 1

(1) We might not be able to distribute the work evenly, and cooperate / communicate effectively

(2) We might face some problems that is beyond the scope of the course.

(3) We might plan out too much features / functions for the product that our current time / money is simply not enough.

##### Problem 2

One of these believes is that we not be able to distribute the work evenly. This comes from my past experience with teamwork. I usually is the one who finish the most part of the work while others are usually not responsive when I actually need to discuss the project with them.
