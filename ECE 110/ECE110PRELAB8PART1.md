##### Problem 1

Software Engineer. In the situation, say I want to develop a new software / service for the company, I need the story-telling skills in order to convey my idea and convince my CEO to give me fund.

##### Problem 2

I need to make sure that the concept mentioned in the video should be understandable by ECE 110 students. I will adapt my story to (1) explain necessary concept that ECE 110 students don't understand (2) make sure the story is specific enough and don't include redundant information that all ECE 110 students should already know.

##### Problem 3

I want to my audience to know that we could use photoresistor to control the behavior of the car.

##### Problem 4

The climax is we know that we could use photoresistor to control the behavior of the car. Then, we could use this information to build a circuit with MOSFET and several other resistors. So, when there isn't light, the current will be supplied to the motor and the car will start moving away.

##### Problem 5

* Exposition: build a light-seeking car
* Inciting incident: we need a device that could detect the light and alter the behavior of the car accordingly.
* Climax: the photoresistor could be used to control the behavior of the car.
* Falling action: we could build a circuit with photoresistor and MOSFET and few other resistors.
* Resolution: show the results, add some reflection on the experiment.
