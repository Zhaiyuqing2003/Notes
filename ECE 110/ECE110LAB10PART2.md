$$
t = RC \ln (\frac { V_p}{V_n}\frac{V_s - V_n}{V_s-V_p}) = 50 \cdot \ln (\fac 4.3/2.8; \cdot \fac 7-2.8/7-4.3; ) = 44.41\m\s
$$

The $V_p$ is the trigger voltage going from low to high, and the $V_n$ is the trigger voltage going from high to low. $V_s$ is the output voltage. These are measured using the oscilloscope.
