##### Problem 1

A thin ring of charge of radius $R$ lies in the $x-y$ plane and is centered on the $z$-axis. The linear charge density, $\lambda$, of the loop depends on the in-plane angle with respect to the $x$-axis, $\phi$. It is given by $\lambda(\phi) = \lambda_0 (1 + \cos\phi)$.

###### (a)

>What is the total charge contained in the ring, $Q_{TOT}$?
