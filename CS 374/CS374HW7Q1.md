##### (a)

We represent the sequence $A = a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_n$ as an array `A[1..n]` in the pseudocode.

To better introduce how we only use $O(n)$ space, we first suppose that there is 2d array called `SPS_memory[1..n, 1..n]` behind the scene (it's not in the actual pseudocode). Where `SPS_memory[i, j]` means the length of shortest palindromic supersequence of the `A[i..j]` minus the length of `A[i..j]` itself. If you see the pseudocode below, the `SPS_memory[i, j]` actually only depends on `SPS_memory[i + 1, j]`, `SPS_memory[i + 1, j - 1]`, `SPS_memory[i, j + 1]`, which means that we only need to store 2 columns of the `SPS_memory` instead of the entire 2d array. 

Therefore, within the outer for loop with `i` looping variable, we define `SPS_array[j]` equal to `SPS_memory[i + 1, j]` and `SPS_next_array[j]` equal to `SPS_memory[i, j]`. This will store enough memoization information.

Few things to notice:

* The `i >= j` is a special case, and in this case the `SPS_next_array[j]` need to be defaulted to `0`. (The  `SPS_next_array[j]` basically means the length of shortest palindromic supersequence of one single character / empty string minus the length of itself. For single character / empty string, itself is already the shortest palindromic supersequence, therefore no additional length needs to be added).
* We need to evaluate `j` from `1` to `n` since in the pseudocode the `SPS_next_array[j]` depends on `SPS_next_array[j - 1]`. We need to evaluate `i` from `n` to `1` since `SPS_next_array` depends on `SPS_array` (this dependency originate from the fact that `SPS_memory[i, j]` depends on `SPS_memory[i + 1, j]`)
* By definition of `SPS_array`, we will return the `SPS_array[n] + n` as the result.

```pseudocode
SPS(A[1..n]):
	SPS_array[1..n] <- []
	
	for i <- n to 1:
		SPS_next_array[1..n] <- []
		for j <- 1 to n:
			if i >= j:
				SPS_next_array[j] <- 0
			else if A[i] = A[j]:
				SPS_next_array[j] <- SPS_array[j - 1]
			else:
				SPS_next_array[j] <- 1 + min(
					SPS_array[j],
					SPS_next_array[j - 1]
				)
		SPS_array <- SPS_next_array
	
	return n + SPS_array[n]
```

We see that there is two for loop in the pseudocode, and the operation in it is $O(1)$ time, therefore the total time complexity is $n^2 \cdot O(1) = O(n^2)$. For space complexity, we see that we only use two array of size $n$. Therefore, the space complexity is just $2 \cdot O(n) = O(n)$ as we desired.



##### (b)

We define a 4d array `SCPS_array[1..m, 1..m, 1..n, 1..n]`. The `SCPS_array[i, j, p, q]` means the length of shortest common palindromic supersequence of `X[i..j]` and `Y[p..q]` minus the sum of the length of `X[i..j]` and `Y[p..q]`. 

Few things to notice:

* There are few special cases:
  * When `i = j and p = q`, we are considering actually the shortest common palindromic supersequence of two single character, if they are same character, then their shortest common palindromic supersequence is just 1 character, which is 1 character less than their length combined. Otherwise the shortest common palindromic supersequence will be 3 characters, 1 character longer than their length combined
  * When `i > j` and `p > q`, we are considering two empty string, and in this case the shortest common palindromic supersequence could be thought as 0 characters, which is 0 characters longer than the combined length of two empty string. 
  * When `i > j and p = q` or `i = j and p > q`, we are considering one single character and one empty string, the shortest common palindromic supersequence is just 1 character long, and 0 character longer than their length combined.
  * When `i > j and p < q` or `i < j and p > q`, we are considering one non-empty string and one empty string, in this case, the shortest common palindromic supersequence is actually just the shortest palindromic supersequence of the non-empty string. (it's similar to part $(a)$)
* The `i` and `p` goes from `m to 1` and `n to 1` respectively, because the `SCPS_array[i, j, p, q]` depends on `SCPS_array[i + 1, j, p, q]` and `SCPS_array[i, j, p + 1, q]`. Similarly, the `j` goes from `1 to m` and `q` goes from `1 to n` because `SCPS_array[i, j, p, q]` depends on `SCPS_array[i, j - 1, p, q]` and `SCPS_array[i, j, p, q - 1]`
* By the definition of `SCPS_array[1..m, 1..m, 1..n, 1..n]`, we will return `m + n + SCPS_array[1, m, 1, n]` in the end

 We notice that there is four for loop, and the operation in the for loop is $O(1)$, therefore, the time complexity is just $m^2n^2 \cdot O(1) = O(m^2 n ^2)$. For space complexity, we see that we store a 4d array which need $O(m^2n^2)$ space.
