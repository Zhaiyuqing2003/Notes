##### High Level Idea

For an interval $P = (a_i, b_i)$, we denote access to the element of $a_i$ as `P[0]` , and $b_i$ as `P[1]`. Also, if we have `a`, `b`. and we want to construct $P = (a, b)$, we denote that as `P = (a, b)`

We define for every two intervals $P = (a_i, b_i)$ and $Q = (a_j, b_j)$. If we have $a_i \le a_j$ and $b_j \le b_i$ we say that $Q$ is **contained** in $P$. There is a graph for the illustration:

$\GRAPH$

This definition will be useful for the explanation. We define a utility function called `IsContained(ai, bi, aj, bj)` to check if $Q = (a_j, b_j)$ is **contained** in $P = (a_i, b_i)$:

```pseudocode
IsContained(P, Q):
	return (P[0] <= Q[0]) and (Q[1] <= P[1])
```

We also have the auxiliary function `OverlapLength(P, Q)` that calculate the overlap length of interval $P$ and $Q$:

```pseudocode
OverlapLength(P, Q):
	return max(0, min(P[1], Q[1]) - max(P[0], Q[0]))
```

Before we begin, first check if the condition `n >= 2` is true, if we are given `0` or `1` interval, it doesn't make any sense to find the maximum overlap length. In this case, we could just end our program, and possibly give / throw a exception.

We begin by sorting the array `A[1..n]` and permuting the array `B[1..n]` to maintain correspondence between endpoints, in $O(n\log n)$ time (`MergeSort`).

We iterate through these sorted `A[1..n]` (with associated `B[1..n]`). We keep a global variable `maximumLength` to track the maximum overlap length between intervals we have seen so far. This sub-process is:

```pseudocode
IterateThroughIntervals(A[1..n], B[1..n]):
	maximumLength <- 0
    lastInterval <- null
	for i <- 1 to n:
		if lastInterval is not null:
			currentInterval <- (A[i], B[i])
			if IsContained(lastInterval, currentInterval):
				maximumLength <- max(maximumLength, currentInterval)
			else:
				maximumLength <- max(
					maximumLength,
					OverlapLength(lastInterval, currentInterval)
				)
				lastInterval <- currentInterval
	return maximumLength	
```

##### Time Complexity Analysis

We see that the the initial sorting of `A` takes $O(n\log n)$ times, and then the `IterateThroughIntervals` takes $O(n)$ (since it has one `for ` loop that loop through all intervals of size $n$). So, the total time complexity is dominated by the initial sorting, which is $O(n\log n )$
