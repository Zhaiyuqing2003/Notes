##### (a)

```pseudocode
Count(tree, marked):
	if ChildrenCount(tree) = 0:
		return 1;

	sum <- 0
	children <- Children(tree)
	
	product <- 1
	for i <- 1 to Length(children):
		product <- product * Count(children[i], false)
	
	sum <- sum + product
	
	if marked:
		return sum
	
    for i <- 1 to Length(children):
    	product <- 1
        for j <- 1 to Length(children):
            if i = j:
            	product <- product * Count(children[j], true)
            else:
            	product <- product * Count(children[j], false)
        sum <- sum + product
    
	return sum
```

##### (b)

$$
T(1) = 1\\
T(2) = 2\\
T(n) = T(n-1)+T(n-2)
$$

The value of $T(500)$ is `139423224561697880139724382870407283950070256587697307264108962948325571622863290691557658876222521294125`, We see that $\log_2(T(500)) > 64$, which means it couldn't be fit into 64-bit word.
