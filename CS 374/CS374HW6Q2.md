We first define two auxiliary functions `GetChicken` and `NegateWord`. `GetChicken` will tell you, for a given value and a word you says, how many chicken you could get. The `NegateWord` simply return the other word given your current word.

```pseudocode
GetChicken(value, word):
	if word = "Ring" return value
	if word = "Ding" return -value
	
NegateWord(word):
	if word = "Ring" return "Ding"
	if word = "Ding" return "Ring"
```

Then we use a 3-d memoization array called `MaxChickenArray[1..n, "Ring" or "Ding", 0..3]`. The syntax `"Ring" or "Ding"` means the second index of the `MaxChickenArray` could either be `Ring` or `Ding`. `MaxChickenArray[i, word, count]`, means that given we already said `word` `count` number of times before, the maximum chicken we could get starting from the `A[i]` to `A[n]`, inclusive.

Then we could see for this array:

* If $i = n$, that means we only have `A[n]` need to consider. If we have said `count = 3` (that is, we said `word` 3 times before),   

```pseudocode
MaxChicken(A[1..n]):
	MaxChickenArray[1..n, "Ring" or "Ding", 0..3]
	
	EvaluateSubProblem(i, word, count):
		if i = n:
			if count = 3: 
				return GetChicken(A[i], NegateWord(word))
			else: 
				return max(
                    GetChicken(A[i], word),
                    GetChicken(A[i], NegateWord(word))
                )
		else:
			if count = 3:
				return getChicken(A[i], NegateWord(word)) +
                		MaxChickenArray[i + 1, NegateWord(word), 1]
			else:
				return max(
					getChicken(A[i], word) + 
						maxChickenArray[i + 1, word, count + 1]
					getChicken(A[i], NegateWord(word)) + 
						MaxChickenArray[i + 1, NegateWord(word), 1]
				)
	
	
	for i <- n to 1:
		foreach word in ["Ring", "Ding"]:
			for count <- 0 to 3:
				EvaluateSubProblem(i, word, count)
	
	return MaxChickenArray[1, "Ring", 0]
```
