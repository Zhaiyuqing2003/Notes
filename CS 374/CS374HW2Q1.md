##### (a)

$$
(0+1)^*111(0+1)^*10 + (0+1)^*1110
$$

The string requires a suffix $10$ and a substring $111$. There two subcases

1. the substring $111$ in string is separated from the suffix $10$ of the string. The corresponding regular expression is $(0+1)^*111(0+1)^*10$. $(0+1)^*$ is the expression for any string.
2. the last letter of substring $111$ in string is the first letter in the suffix $10$ of the string. The corresponding regular expression is $(0+1)^*1110$

##### (b)

$$
1^*0^*1^*
$$

If the string does not contain subsequence $010$, it should not have any $0$ appears after the string already have a subsequence of $01$.

##### (c)

$$
(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*1(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*+ (0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*1(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*1(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*
$$

The regular expression $(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*$ means any string where `1` appears $3n (n \in \N^+)$ times. To make number of `1`s not be divisible by $3$. The `1` should appear either $3n + 1$ or $3n+ 2$ times $(n \in \N^+)$. We insert extra `1`s into the regular expression, $(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*$. This corresponds to $(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*1(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*$ and $(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*1(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*1(0^*10^*10^*10^*)^*$, respectively.

##### (d)

$$
w_1 + w_2 + w_3+\cdots+w_k
$$

Treat each string $w_i$ in $L$ as a regular expression. The regular expression that define the $L$ is the one that accept any string in $L$. The regular expression is thus the union of all the string in $L$.

##### (e)

Define $h = \max_{1\le i\le k} |w_i|$ as the maximum length of all the string in language $L$. Therefore, there are several cases to consider:

1. For $l \le h$, we could pick a subset $S_l \subseteq L$ that $S_l = \{s : |s| = l\}$. We could also have $\Sigma^l$ (that is the set of all string with the length $l$). Define $K_l = \Sigma^l \backslash S_l$. Then $K_l$ is all the string in the $\bar L$ with length $l$, and the regular expression $x_l = \sum_{s \in K_l} s$ (the $\sum$ means regular expression union). For $0 \le i \le h$, the regular expression for all string in $\bar L$ with length less than or equal to $h$ is expressed by (call this regular expression $x$)
   $$
   x  = x_0 + x_i +\cdots + x_h
   $$

2. For any string $s$ that $|s| > h$,  It's in $\bar L$. It could be expressed as $(0+1)^{h+1}
   (0+1)^*$. $(0+1)^{h+1}$ means $(0+1)(0+1)\cdots (0+1)$ for $h+1$ times)

The resulting regular expression is just $x + (0+1)^{h+1}
(0+1)^*$.
