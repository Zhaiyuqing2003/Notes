##### General Idea and Code

We will use the `MomSelect` and `Partition` in the problem. (They are listed in the textbook). We will write `R <- [1..n]` to declare an array of size `n`.

The general idea is that for the list of $h$ indices `H[1..h]` we could choose the median of the `H`. Once we find the median of `H` (call it `m`), we use the `MomSort` to find the corresponding `m`th element in the `A`, and the partition the `A` to have two parts `left` and `right` that is smaller and bigger than the `m`th element, respectively. Then it's true that the indices smaller than `m` is all in the `left` part and indices that is larger than `m` is all in `right` part, this effectively divide and conquer the problem. The pseudocode is shown below:

```pseudocode
SelectK(A[1..n], H[1..h]):
	R <- [1..h]
	SelectKRecursive(A, H, R)
	return R

SelectKRecursive(A[1..n], H[1..h], R[1..h]):
	medianH <- MomSelect(H, ceil(h/2))
	hElement <- MomSelect(A, medianH)
	
	leftA, rightA <- Partition(A, hElement)
	leftH, rightH <- Partition(H, medianH)

	if leftH is not empty:
		SelectKRecursive(leftA, leftH, R)
	if rightH is not empty:
		SelectKRecursive(rightA, rightH, R)	
```

##### Time Complexity Analysis

The main point of concern is the `SelectKRecursive` function which calls itself recursively. We see that the the for the base case when `h = 1`. (`leftH` and `rightH` is empty so there won't be any recursion in this case) The work done on the node is:

* `MomSelect` on `H` and `A`, it is $O(k)$ and $O(n)$, respectively.
* `Partition` on `H` and `A`, it is also $O(k)$ and $O(n)$, respectively.

In this case, the time complexity is mainly dominated by $O(n)$. Therefore, the base case has $T(n, k = 1) = O(n)$ time complexity. 

Then, we see the inductive case, when $A$ is get partition by `hElement`, we could assume there exist an $0 \le l \le 1$, and the partitioned `leftA` and `rightA` part have approximately size of `ln` and `(1-l)n`, respectively. (The `floor`/`ceil`/`+1/-1` doesn't really matter here), and since the `medianH` is the median of the `H`, the partitioned `leftH` and `rightH` both have approximately size of `h/2`. Then we see that the two subcases have time complexity of $T(ln, h/2)$ and $T((1-l)n, h/2)$. We also see that for the work done on the node, it has two parts

* `MomSelect` on `H` and `A`, it is $O(k)$ and $O(n)$, respectively.
* `Partition` on `H` and `A`, it is also $O(k)$ and $O(n)$, respectively.

So we see that work done on node is $O(n)$. Therefore, we could write the recurrence:
$$
\begin{align}
T(n, h) &= O(n) + T(ln, h/2) + T((1-l)n, h/2) \quad (0 \le l \le 1)\\
T(n, 1) &= O(n)
\end{align}
$$
We could use the same approach on our GPS. (List the table first)

| Levels  | (Work Per Node, <br />Number Of Nodes)                | (Case, Number of Case)                                       | Total Work |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------- |
| Level 0 | $(n , 1)$                                             | $(T(n,h)$                                                    | $n$        |
| Level 1 | $(ln, 1)$<br />$((1-l)n, 1)$                          | $(T(ln, h/2), 1)$<br />$(T((1-l)n, h/2), 1)$                 | $n$        |
| Level 2 | $(l^2n, 1)$ <br />$(l(1-l)n, 2)$<br />$((1-l)^2n, 1)$ | $(T(l^2n, h/4),1)$<br />$(T((1-l)ln, h/4), 2)$<br />$(T((1-l)^2n, h/4), 1)$ | $n$        |

We see the trend that for level `L`, the work is always $n$, a constant sequence. (The variable $l$ we introduced just get cancelled) Therefore, the total time complexity is `workPerLevel * numberOfLevels`. We see that the the $T(n, h)$ will go to base case when its $h$ goes to $1$. From the table, we see that the level $L$ will have all subcases $T(\_, h/2^L)$ (the $\_$ means we don't care about the first parameter in $T$). Therefore we see that $h/2^L = 1$ and $L = \log_2 h$. We have $L = \log_2 h$ levels. Therefore, the total time complexity is just $O(n) \cdot O(\log h) = O(n\log h)$ as we desired.

##### General Idea and Code

```pseudocode
SelectFromFour(A1[1..a1], A2[1..a2], A3[1..a3], A4[1..a4], k):
	if k = 1:
		return min(A1[1], A2[1], A3[1], A4[1])
	
	index <- floor(k/4)
	
	indexA1 <- max(|A1|, index)
	indexA2 <- max(|A2|, index)
	indexA3 <- max(|A3|, index)
	indexA4 <- max(|A4|, index)
	
	maxElement <- max(indexA1, indexA2, indexA3, indexA4)
	
	if indexA1 = maxElement:
		SelectFromFour(A1, A2[indexA2:a2], A3[indexA3:a3], A4[indexA4:a4], k - index*3)
	if indexA2 = maxElement:
		SelectFromFour(A1, A2[indexA2:a2], A3[indexA3:a3], A4[indexA4:a4], k - index*3)
```
