##### (a)

There are few cases:

* Yulie drives to one shop $x \in X$, and then goes to Aaron's place $t$ directly, no need to add fuel.
* Yulie first drives to gas station $y \in Y$, and then goes to one shop $x \in X$, and finally goes to Aaron's place $t$.
* Yulie first drives to one shop $x \in X$, and then goes to the gas station $y \in Y$, and finally goes to Aaron's place $t$.

we first construct a new graph $G' = (V', E')$ such that $V' = V \cross \{ F, T\}$.  The $\{F, T\}$ stores the information whether we visited the shop yet, $F$ means we haven't visited it yet, $T$ means we have visited it. For every edge $e = (v, u) \in E$, we have

* if $u \in X$, then there is edge $e' = (v, g) \to (u, T)$ for $g \in \{F, T\}$.
* Otherwise, then there is edge $e' = (v, g) \to (u, g)$ for $g \in \{F, T\}$.

We could then first run Dijkstra on $G'$, record all the shortest distance from the $(s, F)$ to all other nodes in $V'$. Then we get the reverse of $G'$, the $G'_{\text{rev}}$. We run another Dijkstra on $G'_{\text{rev}}$, and we could record the shortest distance from $(t, T)$ to all other nodes in $V'$ in graph $G'_{\text{rev}}$. Notice this is equivalent to the shortest distance from all other nodes in $V'$ to $(t, T)$ in graph $G'$. Then we check:

* If the minimum distance from $(s, F)$ to $(t, T)$, the $\dist((s, F), (t, T)) \le D$, then that means we could by the gift and directly go to Aaron's house, no need to add oil. (of course, we could pass a gas station, but this doesn't necessarily we have to add oil there). If this is true, we set $\dist_1 = \dist((s, F), (t, T))$, otherwise we set $\dist_1 = \infin$
* For all the $(y, T) \in V'$ that $y \in Y$ and also that $\dist((s, F), (y, T)) \le D$, we find the $\text{dist}_{y, T} = \dist((s, F), (y, T)) + \dist((y, T), (t, T))$. We take the minimum of all $\dist_{y, T}$ and call it $\dist_2$. (If there is not such $(y, T)$, we set $\dist_2 = \infin$) This is the case when Yulie first drives to one shop $x \in X$, and then goes to the gas station $y \in Y$, and finally goes to Aaron's place $t$.
* For all the $(y, F) \in V'$ that $y \in Y$ and also that $\dist((s, F), (y, F)) \le D$, we find the $\text{dist}_{y, F} = \dist((s, F), (y, F)) + \dist((y, F), (t, T))$. We take the minimum of all $\dist_{y, F}$ and call it $\dist_3$ (If there is not such $(y, F)$, we set $\dist_3 = \infin$). This is the case when Yulie first drives to gas station $y \in Y$, and then goes to one shop $x \in X$, and finally goes to Aaron's place $t$.

The final result is $\dist = \min(\dist_1, \dist_2, \dist_3)$, the minimum of three possible cases. We see that we first  uses two Dijkstra to find all the distance from $s$ to each node, and the distance from each node to $t$. This takes $2\cdot \dijkstra(V', E')$. Then we see that for the second and third case, when we iterate every possible cases in $Y$, we have $O(V')$ time complexity. We notice that $|V'| = 2|V|$ and that $|E'| = 2|E'|$. 

So, in the end, the total time complexity is just $2\cdot \dijkstra(V', E') + 2O(V') = O(V\log V + E)$

##### (b)

We first develop a short-hand notation $U = \{s, t\} \cup Y$. Then we construct a new vertex set $V' = U \cross \{F, T\}$. The $\{F, T\}$ stores the information whether we visited the shop yet, $F$ means we haven't visited it yet, $T$ means we have visited it.

Then for the new edge set $E'$ that connects vertices in $V'$, it includes the following:

* For every vertex $v' \in U$, we run a Dijkstra in $G$ starting from $v'$. Then for every $u' \in U'\backslash v'$, our Dijkstra could tell us the $\dist(v', u')$ and the corresponding path $p$ goes from $v'$ to $u'$ that has minimum distance. if $\dist(v', u') \le R$, there are two cases:
  * If there is a vertex $x$ in the path $p$ (notice this considers the start and the end) such that $x \in X$, then we add new edge $e' = (v', g) \to (u', T)$, where $v', u' \in V'$ and $g \in \{F, T\}$.
  * Otherwise, we add new edge $e' = (v', g) \to (u', g)$, where $v', u' \in V'$ and $g \in \{F, T\}$.

Since for every vertex in the $V'$, we need to run Dijkstra in $G$, this will result in $O(V\cdot \dijkstra(V, E))$ time complexity to construct the $E'$. 

Then let the new graph be $G' = (V', E')$. The original problem on $G$ then is equivalent of finding the minimum distance from the $(s, F)$ to $(t, T)$. This could be done by one Dijkstra on the new $G'$. We know that the new graph has $|V'| = 2(|Y| + 2) = O(V)$ and that the upper bound for the $|E'|$ is $O(V^2)$

So, in the end, the time complexity is just $O(V\cdot \dijkstra(V, E)) + \dijkstra(V', E')$. We know that $\dijkstra(V, E)$ is $O(V\log V + E)$ so the time complexity is just $O(V^2 \log V + VE) + O(V'\log V' + E')$ =  $O(V^2 \log V + VE)$. (The last $\dijkstra(V', E')$ is not the dominate term in the final time complexity)
