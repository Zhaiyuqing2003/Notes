##### (a)

Define a function $z(v)$ that takes a node and output 1 if $c(v) = 0$ and $0$ is $c(v) \neq 0$

Create a new graph $G' = (V', E')$ such that

* $V' = V \cross \{0, 1, 2, 3 \} \cup \{(x, 0), (y, 0)\}$ the exact value of $x$ and $y$ doesn't matter, as long as that they are not in $E$ and $c(x) = c(y) \neq 0$)
* For every edge $(u, v)$ from $E$, there exists edge that:
  * $(u, 0) \to (v, z(v))$
  * $(u, 1) \to (v, 1 + z(v))$
  * $(u, 2) \to (v, 2 + z(v))$
  * if $z(v) = 0$, then there is $(u, 3) \to (v, 3)$
* We add additional edges
  * $(x, 0) \to (x_i, c)$, where $c \in \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}$ and $x_i \in X$.
  * for $y_i \in Y$:
    * $(y_i, 0) \to (y, 0)$
    * $(y_i, 1) \to (y, 0)$
    * $(y_i, 2) \to (y, 0)$
    * if $z(y_i) = 0$, then there is $(y_i, 3) \to (y, 0)$

Then finding the path contains at most three nodes with color that are not 0 starting from a vertex in $X$ end in a vertex in $Y$ is **equivalent** as finding whether $(y, 0)$ is reachable from $(x, 0)$.

We see that $|V'| = 3|V| + 2 = O(V)$ and that $|E'|$ is between $3|E| + 4|X| + 3|Y|$ and $4|E| + 4|X| + 4|Y|$ (inclusive, this depends how many nodes satisfy $z(v) = 0$). But we see that $|E'| = O(E)$ nevertheless. Then we could run a `whatever-first search` (let's choose either `DFS` or `BFS` in this case) on the $G'$ as previously stated. This algorithm takes $O(V'+E') = O(V + E)$

##### (b)

Define a function $z(e)$ that takes a edge and output 1 if $c(e) = 0$ and $0$ is $c(e) \neq 0$

Create a new graph $G' = (V', E')$ such that

* $V' = V \cross \{0, 1, 2, 3 \} \cup \{(x, 0), (y, 0)\}$ (the exact value of $x$ and $y$ doesn't matter, as long as that they are not in $E$,)
* For every edge $e = (u, v)$ from $E$, there exists edge that:
  * $(u, 0) \to (v, z(e))$
  * $(u, 1) \to (v, 1 + z(e))$
  * $(u, 2) \to (v, 2 + z(e))$
  * if $z(e) = 0$, then there is $(u, 3) \to (v, 3)$
* We add additional edges
  * $e = (x, 0) \to (x_i, c)$, where $c \in \{ 0, 1, 2, 3 \}$ and $x_i \in X$, and $c(e) \neq 0$
  * $e = (y_i, c) \to (y, 0)$, where $c \in \{0,1, 2, 3\}$ and $y_i \in Y$, and $c(e) \neq 0$

Then finding the path contains at most three edges with color that are not 0 starting from a vertex in $X$ end in a vertex in $Y$ is **equivalent** as finding whether $(y, 0)$ is reachable from $(x, 0)$.

We see that $|V'| = 3|V| + 2 = O(V)$ and that $|E'|$ is between $3|E| + 4|X| + 4|Y|$ and $4|E| + 4|X| + 4|Y|$ (inclusive, this depends how many edges satisfy $z(e) = 0$). But we see that $|E'| = O(E)$ nevertheless. Then we could run a `whatever-first search` (let's choose either `DFS` or `BFS` in this case) on the $G'$ as previously stated.
