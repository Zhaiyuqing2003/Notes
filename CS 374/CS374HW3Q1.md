The first entry ($0, 1, 2$) in the state means the number of blocks 0s of even length the NFA have so far matched. The second entry indicates the property of currently matched blocks of 0s. The $\epsilon$ that there is no currently matched block of 0s, the odd / even means that the length of current matched blocks of 0s is odd /even, respectively.
