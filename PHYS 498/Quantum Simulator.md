## Quantum Simulator

### Quantum State

#### Vector-Based

One simplest Idea is to implement the state as vector. For $\text{wirelength = n}$, produce $2^n$ length vector. Example: suppose $\text{wirelength} = 1$, then $0.6\state{0} + 0.8\state{1}$ is $\left[\matrix{0.6 \\ 0.8} \right]$, and the code for that is

```ts
const vecOne = Vector.fromArray([0.6, 0.8]); // or
const vecTwo = Vector.zeros(2 ** 1);
vecTwo.set(0, ComplexNumber.fromReal(0.6));
vecTwo.set(0, ComplexNumber.fromReal(0.8));
```

#### String-State based

This is the structure explained in the **Simulator II**, however, instead of using structure `[string, ComplexNumber][]`, the `Map<string, ComplexNumber>`. The reason is that `Map` doesn't need to consider duplication problem and only save the space by not storing all the state configurations. (this lead to better performance). The code for generating a quantum state is

```tsx
const stateOne = QuantumState.create(2) // no state stored, wireLength = 2;
const stateTwo = QuantumState.zero(2) // |00>
const stateThree = QuantumState.unique(2, "10") // |10>
```

#### Number-State based

Instead of using structure like `Map<string, ComplexNumber>`, the `Map<number, ComplexNumber>` could be used where a decimal number represent the state. This lead to faster implementation of the quantum gate later.

```tsx
const stateOne = QuantumVectorState.create(2) //no state stored, wireLength = 2;
const stateTwo = QuantumVectorState.zero(2) // |00>
const stateThree = QuantumVectorState.unique(2, 2) // |10>
```

### Quantum Gate

There are three elementary gate we use:

1. **Hadamard**, denote as $\H{a}$
2. **Phase**, denote as $\P{a}{\theta}$
3. **Control-X** (or **Control Not**), denote as $\Cx{a}{b}$

While all the gates could be built upon those three gates, or be estimated in certain number of gates, some gates could be directly implemented to improve the speed.

#### Different Gate Implementations

##### Direct Matrix Method (Simulator Ia)

Express all the gates in the **Quantum Circuit** as `Matrix[]`, then multiply the matrix together, then use the resulted `Matrix` to multiply the state `Vector`, and get the final `Vector`.

The matrix multiplication has time complexity $O(m^3)$, where $m = 2^n$, So the overall complexity is $O(8^n)$

##### Matrix Method (Simulator Ib)

Express all the gates in the **Quantum Circuit** as `Matrix[]`, multiply the input `Vector` by each `Matrix`, and get the final `Vector`.

The vector multiplication has time complexity $O(m^2)$, where $m = 2^n$, So the overall complexity is $O(4^n)$ 

##### Sparse Matrix Method (Simulator Ic)

Express all the gates in the **Quantum Circuit** as `SparseMatrix[]`, multiply the input state `Vector` by each `SparseMatrix`, and get the final `Vector`.

Technically, the worse-case time complexity is still $O(4^n)$, but consider

1. Hadamard $\h$ only have $2m$ entries
2. Phase $\p\theta$ only have $m$ entries
3. Control-X $\cx$ only have $m$ entries

The entries in the sparse matrix $E = km$, where $k$ is a constant.

So, the vector multiplication, on average, only takes $O(m) = O(2^n)$

##### String-State-Based State Transformer Method (Simulator II variant)

Express all gates in the **Quantum Circuit** as `TransformFunction<QuantumState>[]`, transform the input `QuantumState` by each `TransformFunction<QuantumState>`, and get final `QuantumState`.

The `TransformFunction<QuantumState>` works by manipulate the string 

The theoretical worse-case time complexity is $O(2^n)$, since the transform will apply on each state configuration. However, consider

1. Hadamard $\h$ split $1$ state configuration into $2$.
2. Phase $\p\theta$ transform $1$ state configuration into $0$ or $1$ configurations.
3. Control-X $\cx$ negate $1$ state configuration into $1$ another configuration.

So, for a `QuantumState`, the size $m'$ of its `Map` is smaller than $2^n$, sometimes far smaller for certain list of gates (if there are less $\h$), and it generally yield far better speed. (See the speed benchmark in [Speed Comparison](#Speed Comparison) section).

As a rough estimation, the number of state usually depends on number of $\h$ in the circuit. For each $\h$ applied, there will be roughly $r$ times more state configurations. The $r$ should be within in $[1, 2]$ and depends on the number of $\h$ already added called $h$, the total `wireLength` $n$, and the specific input state $s$. So,
$$
r(h, n, s) \in [1, 2] \quad \lim_{h \to \infin}r(h, n, s) = 1 \\
r'(h, n, s) < 0 \quad \lim_{h \to \infin}r'(h, n, s) = 0 \\
$$

The total number of configuration $m'$ could thus be estimated as
$$
m' = \text{len}(s)\prod_{i = 1}^h r(i, n, s) \leq m
$$
Just as a pure assumption, the $r$ should like the red function below, where the purple function is the $n' = \log(m') \approx \log(\text{len}(s))\sum_{i}^{x}\log(r(h, n, s))$. The x-axis is the number of the $\h$.

<iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/1dajelsbfl?embed" width="500" height="250" style="border: 1px solid #ccc" frameborder=0></iframe>

So, suppose there are `h` number of $\h$, the number of state configuration is
$$
m' = 2^{n'(h, n)}
$$
and the total time complexity is $O(2^{n'(h, n)})$, an decrease of factor $2^{n - n'(h, n)}$.

##### Vector-Based State Transformer Method (Simulator III)

Express all gates in the **Quantum Circuit** as `TransformFunction<Vector>[]`, transform the input `Vector` by each `TransformFunction<Vector>`, and get final `Vector`. The difference of `TransformFunction<Vector>` is that it uses the same bitwise algorithm as the method below. Since `Vector` has length $2^n$, it has a time complexity $O(2^n)$

##### Number-State-Based State Transformer Method (Simulator IV)

Essentially the same process as the String-State-Based State Transformer, the only difference is that the `TransformFunction<QuantumVectorState>` uses **bitwise** calculation instead of **string manipulation** to find the next `QuantumVectorState`, this improve the speed by a constant factor `k`. 



#### Basis Gate

Basis Gate are defined as **un-inverted and uncontrolled** gates.

##### Single Wire Gate

The common single wire gate could be directly implemented with either `Matrix/SparseMatrix`, `QuantumVectorState/Vector`, `QuantumState`

there are 4 implemented in the code $\h$, $\x$, $\p\theta$, and $\rz\theta$

###### Matrix Implementation

1. **Hadamard** $\h = {1\over \sqrt2}\begin{bmatrix}
   	1 & 1 \\
   	1 & -1
   \end{bmatrix} $
2. **Pauli** $\x = \begin{bmatrix}
   	0 & 1 \\
   	1 & 0
   \end{bmatrix}$​
3. **Phase** $\p\theta = \begin{bmatrix}
   	1 & 0 \\
   	0 & e^{i\theta}
   \end{bmatrix}$​
4. **Rotation Z**, $\rz\theta = \begin{bmatrix}
   	e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}} & 0 \\
   	0 & e^{i\frac{\theta}{2}}
   \end{bmatrix}$​

while these are the associated matrix when applied on single wire, any single-wire unitary matrix $\Gate{U}{a}$ (applied on $a$) for multiple wire could be achieved by using tensor product:
$$
\gate{U} = \Gate{I}{2^{a}}\otimes\Gate{U}{a}\otimes\Gate{I}{2^{n - a - 1}}
$$

##### Speed Comparison

##### Non-Atomic Gate

###### Description for <u>Not / PauliX</u>

The `Not` is just the `PauliX`, its description in matrix is
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 \\
	1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Suppose the `Not(wire)`, it could be expressed as

```pseudocode
define (`X {wire}` : string) is string {
    H {wire}
    P {wire, PI}
    H {wire}
}
```

We could verify this by multiply the matrix
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 \\
	1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 \\
	1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	0 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot 
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 1 \\
	1 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
which indicates some fundamental relation between $\text{Pauli Gates}$.
$$
\text{Z = HXH} \quad \text{and} \quad \text{X = HZH}
$$
where 
$$
\text{Z} = \text{P($\pi$)}
$$
in that sense, the $\text{H}$ is change-basis matrix between $x$ and $z$ axis in Bloch Sphere.

##### Description for <u>Rz</u>

The description for `Rz`, in two wires, is just
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & e^{i\frac{\theta}{2}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
Suppose `Rz(wire, phase)`, it could be expressed as

```pseudocode
define (`RZ {wire} {phase}` : string) is string {
	X {wire}
	P {wire, -phase / 2}
	X {wire}
	P {wire, phase / 2}
}
```

We could verify this by multiply the matrix
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & e^{i\frac{\theta}{2}}
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 \\
	1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot \begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	0 & e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}} \\
\end{bmatrix} \cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
	0 & 1 \\
	1 & 0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 \\
	0 & e^{i\frac{\theta}{2}} \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$
that is
$$
R_z(\theta) = \text{P}\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\text{X}\text{P}\left(-\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\text{X}
$$

##### Description of <u>Control Rz</u>

The `CRz` takes similar form of $C_U$


$$
\begin{bmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & e^{-i\frac{\theta}{2}} & 0 \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & e^{i\frac{\theta}{2}}
\end{bmatrix}
$$
