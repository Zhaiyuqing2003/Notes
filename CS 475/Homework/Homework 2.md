Define a CFG $G = (\{ S, A \}, \{ a, b, \#\}, P, S)$ where $P$ has following rules
$$
S \to aS \bigm | bS \bigm | aA \\
A \to \# \bigm | aAa \bigm | bA \bigm | Ab
$$

Note for myself (a proof):

$A$ is the Warmup 3.2 CFG, and we have proved that it constructs a CFL where $\#_a(u) = \#_a(v)$. Then it’s obvious that $S = (a|b)^*aA$ which will have $\#_a(u) > \#_a(v)$, and it’s obvious that $L(G) \sube B$.  For the other way around, then the smallest string in $B$ is $a\#$, which in this case could be generated by $S \to aA, A \to \#$. For the induction, we have induction hypothesis that if $|w| < n$ then $S$ could generate it, consider a string $|w| = n$,  Suppose $w$ as $w = ay$, since $\#_a(u) > \#(v)$, then we could write $y = u'\#v'$, where either $\#_a(u') = \#_a(v')$ or $\#_a(u') > \#_a(v')$.  Suppose $\#_a(u') = \#_a(v')$, then we know $A$ could generate the grammar, so $S \to aA \to_G^* ay = w$. Suppose $\#_a(u') > \#_a(v')$, then $|y| < n$, then $S$ could generate it, then we see that we could generate $w$ as $S \to aS \displaystyle\to^*_G ay=w$. Suppose $w = by$, then we know that $\#_a(u') > \#_a(v')$ and $|y| < n$, then from the inductive hypothesis, $S$ could generate $y$. So, again, we could also generate $w$ as $S \to bS \displaystyle\to^*_G by=w$. Finally, $w$ could not be $\#y$, because that violate the condition $\#_a(u) > \#(v)$.
