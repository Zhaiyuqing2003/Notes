#### Problem 1

##### (a)

The key difference is that AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service  where you run code in response to events without managing servers, while AWS EC2 provides virtual machines where you have full control over the  server, including provisioning, configuration, and management.

##### (b)

AWS Lambda's pricing is based on request count and duration, while AWS  Spot Instances use bidding for variable pricing. Lambda functions are  short-lived and event-driven, while Spot Instances can run longer but  may be terminated with a two-minute notice.

##### (c)

Azure functions and Google cloud functions

##### (d)

For simple event-driven tasks and lightweight processing, choose serverless options like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions. For complex,  long-running applications (like game server) requiring customizability and computational power , AWS EC2 is a better choice.

##### (c)

GPUs are versatile, widely used for various tasks for its parallel execution ability (primarily graphic rendering), including machine learning. TPUs, specific to Google Cloud, excel in deep learning due to optimized architecture and faster performance for matrix operations, making them ideal for AI workloads, but less versatile and widely available than GPUs.

#### Problem 7

The claim is *half-correct*. As lecture 5 slides proved, both form of gossip have a time complexity of $O(\log N)$ for spreading the $N/2$ of all nodes. Yet, for the second half of the pull gossip, the pull gossip takes $O(\log \log N)$ rather than $O(\log N)$ in pull gossip. (For the proof, it will just refer the slides rather than proving it again)

So, for the first half of the gossip, the claim is not correct, the time complexity between is both $O(\log N)$, for the second half of the gossip, the claim is correct.

#### Problem 8

##### (a)

No, you couldn't. Since foreach subnet, you could only infect your next subnet. That means, suppose we start at subnet 1, then it could only infect subnet 2. For subnet 2, the shortest time that it must wait before infecting subnet 3 is $O(\log \sqrt N) \cdot $ time. We notice that to infect next subnet, we have to take $O(\sqrt N)$ time. Since we start from $S(0)$ subnet, and we need to infect all the way to the $S(\sqrt N -1)$ subnet, that means, we have to take $O(\log \sqrt N) \cdot \sqrt N$ time at minimum, that is $O(\sqrt N \cdot \log \sqrt N)$, this minimum time is even bigger than the $O(\log N)$ we aim for. So, it's **impossible** to have an $O(\log N)$

##### (b)

We know that for the topology-aware gossip given in the lecture 5

<img src="./Homework 1.assets/image-20230913113859574.png" alt="image-20230913113859574" style="zoom:33%;" />

If we want to achieve router load of $O(1)$, then we need to pick the gossip target with probability $(1 - 1/n_i)$. The reason why it's the case is because for each node in subnet $i$, it has a probability choosing a target outside of the node of $1/n_i$, therefore, all the nodes in that subnet has a expectation value of choosing the outside node for single gossip round is $n_i \cdot 1/n_i = 1$, since in the example given in lecture, there are only 2 nodes (therefore the expected inter-subnet gossips is $2$), therefore the router load is $O(1)$. 

However, in the problem cases, considering one scenario where there are half of the subnet $\half \sqrt N$  infected, and all of them passed that 'restriction' cool down period. (This scenario is rare, but possible) In this case, foreach subnet, the expected value of choosing the target outside that subnet is $\sqrt{N} \cdot 1/\sqrt N = 1$, and there are $\half \sqrt N$ subnet, so the total load of the router will be $O(\sqrt N)$. That means we couldn't maintain $O(1)$ load on router at any time
