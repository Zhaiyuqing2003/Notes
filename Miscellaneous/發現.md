the reason that rank(row space)  = rank(column space) is because the linear combination (column space) and projection (row space via dot product, a kind of projection) have same rank.

In column space point of view, if two column vectors are dependent, then their span will be the max span. In row space point of view, if two row vector are dependent, then the projection on to them will be proportional, and therefore the corresponding Ax = b, b will not have max rank.

linear combination --> get coordinates based on the span of the column vector

projection -> get coordinates based on the projected length to each row vector



rank(null) + rank(row space) = <--> size

row space --> linear combination / span of row vector

null space --> projection on to the row vector span (which gets 0, means perpendicular, and therefore perpendicular to the span)



variance --> difference in distance --minimize--> projection

var(y-yp) -> minimize (y-yp)^2 --> minimize vec y - vec yp --> minimize vec y - A(x)k --> project y to A(x)k will have shortest (e) vector --> A^T y=A^TA k --> solve

particular x = A(x), x^T y = cov(x, y), x^T x = var(x), k = cov(x, y) / var(x)
