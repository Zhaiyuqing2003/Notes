A Comparative Analysis of Alice in Borderland and Squid Game
By Yuqing

In recent years, two dystopian series—Alice in Borderland and Squid Game—have captivated global audiences with their intense narratives and thought-provoking social commentary. Both shows revolve around deadly games that force characters to confront their fears, values, and survival instincts in high-stakes environments. This essay explores the similarities and differences between the two series and analyzes what these portrayals of “game worlds” signify as allegories for contemporary industrialized societies. Additionally, it will delve into the roles of the main characters, the metaphorical meanings of the games, and the tone of each narrative, while also reflecting on the dystopian themes presented by Gregory Claeys in his analysis of dystopian fiction.
Similarities Between Alice in Borderland and Squid Game

Both Alice in Borderland and Squid Game depict life-and-death games where players are forced into situations beyond their control, highlighting the relentless competition that mirrors contemporary society's struggles. In both series, the games serve as microcosms of the world outside, where economic disparities and personal failings push individuals to extremes. Squid Game centers on Seong Gi-hun and his fellow contestants, who participate in a series of brutal childhood games to win a life-changing sum of money. In contrast, Alice in Borderland follows Arisu and his friends as they are mysteriously transported to an abandoned Tokyo where they must compete in increasingly dangerous challenges to survive.

A common theme in both series is the exploration of the dark side of capitalist societies, where economic pressures and class struggles manifest in literal games of survival. The desperation of Squid Game participants is driven by overwhelming debt and poverty, while Alice in Borderland explores existential crises and disillusionment with modern life. Both shows use their game worlds to reflect on the harsh reality that individuals are often reduced to mere pawns in systems that devalue human life, a concept that Claeys associates with dystopian regimes where "much of the population lives in a constant state of fear"

Differences in Allegory and Tone

Despite their similarities, Alice in Borderland and Squid Game offer distinct interpretations of the "game world" as an allegory. In Squid Game, the games are a direct reflection of societal inequality, with a clear focus on economic exploitation. The contestants voluntarily enter the games in the hope of financial salvation, only to realize that their fates are controlled by unseen wealthy elites, who view their suffering as entertainment. The metaphor is clear: the participants' struggle for survival mirrors the economic hardship faced by many in capitalist societies, where the poor must compete for resources while the rich benefit from their labor.

In contrast, Alice in Borderland presents its game world as a more abstract dystopia. The characters are thrust into the games without their consent and must decipher the rules of this strange, alternate version of Tokyo. The series explores themes of alienation and existential dread, as the characters question the meaning of their lives and the nature of reality itself. While Squid Game focuses on the social consequences of economic inequality, Alice in Borderland emphasizes the psychological toll of isolation and the search for meaning in an indifferent world.

Another significant difference between the two series is their tone. Squid Game ultimately carries a more hopeful message, as Gi-hun’s arc suggests that individual morality and compassion can triumph over systemic cruelty. By the end of the series, Gi-hun rejects the games and chooses to fight back against the system, hinting at the possibility of redemption. In contrast, Alice in Borderland has a bleaker tone. The characters often question whether their suffering has any purpose, and the show's open-ended conclusion leaves little hope for escape from the oppressive game world.
The Role of the Main Characters and the Meaning of the Games

The main characters in both series are reluctant participants who evolve over the course of the games. In Squid Game, Gi-hun is a deeply flawed but sympathetic protagonist. Initially driven by selfishness and desperation, he eventually learns to value human connections and makes moral choices, even when doing so threatens his chances of survival. Arisu in Alice in Borderland begins as an apathetic and directionless individual, but his experiences in the games force him to confront his own failings and grow into a leader who values cooperation and strategy.

The games themselves serve as metaphors for the characters’ struggles. In Squid Game, the games represent the brutal, zero-sum competition of capitalist societies, where only the strongest—or most ruthless—survive. The game metaphor critiques a system that forces individuals to exploit one another for survival, with the final twist revealing that the wealthy elites are behind the entire ordeal. Alice in Borderland uses its games to question the nature of existence and the meaning of life. The strange and often surreal challenges in the series force the characters to confront their deepest fears and desires, making the games an allegory for the search for purpose in a world that often seems indifferent to human suffering.
Dystopian Themes and the Influence of Technology

Both series present dystopian visions of society, drawing on the tradition of dystopian fiction described by Gregory Claeys. In his work on dystopia, Claeys discusses how dystopian societies often maintain control through fear, surveillance, and alienation

. In Squid Game, the contestants are constantly monitored by masked guards, and their every move is manipulated by the game's unseen creators. This reflects Claeys' idea of dystopias as societies where individuals are isolated and dehumanized by systems of power. The use of technology in both series—whether in the form of the elaborate surveillance in Squid Game or the mysterious mechanisms behind the games in Alice in Borderland—serves to further alienate the characters and strip them of their autonomy.

However, the depiction of technology in the two series differs. Squid Game portrays technology as a tool of oppression, used by the elite to control and manipulate the contestants. In Alice in Borderland, technology is more ambiguous, functioning as part of the mysterious game world that the characters must navigate, but with no clear source or purpose. This reflects the different ways in which dystopian narratives can approach the theme of technology: as a tool of control or as a symbol of humanity's existential struggle.
Conclusion

In conclusion, both Alice in Borderland and Squid Game offer compelling allegories for the struggles faced by individuals in contemporary industrialized societies. While Squid Game focuses on the destructive forces of economic inequality and class conflict, Alice in Borderland delves deeper into themes of alienation and existential dread. Through their portrayal of deadly games, both series explore the dehumanizing effects of modern systems of power and control, offering viewers a chilling reflection of the world we live in today. As Claeys suggests, dystopian fiction often serves as a warning about the dangers of unchecked power and the loss of individual agency, themes that are central to both series
