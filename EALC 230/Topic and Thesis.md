Topic: Anime and Postmodern Social Anxieties in East Asia

Thesis: 

The shift from narrative-driven to *database-oriented* anime reveals deeper social and cultural anxieties of the fragmented and fast-paced lifestyle in postmodern East Asia society.



Note (to myself largely):

Probably will be a video essay, since there will be a lot of analysis based on specific time slice in the episodes, the video essay format will suit this best.

One reference is the database animal, and I will also pick few signature anime episodes / their derivatives to do detailed scene analysis. 

I do not know if there are better phrase than “database-oriented”, maybe there are better phrase to describe the exact type of anime, but I think it is good for now. (one alternative is “Template-driven anime”, but that doesn’t capture the “database” especially mentioned in the book).

I want to go through history of anime production, see how the narrative anime gradually changed to *database-oriented* anime, where the character are often a plain archetype with *chara-moe*, and the plot are lack of uniqueness and deeper meaning (narratives). Then, analyze the social background in contemporary Japan and East Asia, see how the change in lifestyle in recent decades shapes the audience preference on type of anime, and how that eventually results in the fanbase and anime industry we seen today.
