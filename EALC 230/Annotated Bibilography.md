  This article provides an overview of Japan's economic and employment shifts since the 1990s, examining the decline of the seniority wage and lifetime employment systems in favor of outcome-based wages and increased non-regular employment. With rising job mobility, diverse work patterns, and the intensifying issue of *karoshi* (death from overwork), the article argues that long work hours are a result of adapting to demanding work environments rather than individual choice. Addressing *karoshi* requires redefining workers' rights within Japanese companies and society. This article will support my analysis of how economic instability and intense work culture in Japan contribute to fragmented lifestyles and escapism, reflected in the database-oriented consumption of anime in postmodern East Asia.

  *Moé: Exploring Japanese Fandom Culture* examines "moé," the intense emotional attachment fans feel for anime and manga characters, tracing its roots in Japanese pop culture. Through expert interviews, the author provides insights into how moé shapes fan behavior, from cosplay to virtual relationships. Illustrated and with a glossary, this book offers a compelling look at Japan’s fan culture. It will help analyze how moé appeared during the transition from narrative-driven to database-oriented anime, illustrating how fan attachments reflect the fragmented lifestyle and social anxieties of postmodern East Asia, supporting my thesis.

  *Otaku: Japan's Database Animals* by Hiroki Azuma explores the shift in otaku culture from "narrative consumption" to "database consumption," where fans engage with fragmented character elements instead of cohesive stories with narratives. This shift reflects postmodern trends of isolated, consumer-focused identities. Analyzing works like *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, Azuma shows how otaku culture values these deconstructed elements, mirroring broader societal disconnection. This source is crucial for my analysis, helping illustrate how anime's database-oriented appeal resonates with the fragmented, fast-paced lifestyles in postmodern East Asia.
