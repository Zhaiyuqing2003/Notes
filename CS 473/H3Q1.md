#### Subproblems

Define $F(v, i)$ for $v \in T$ and $i \in [0, k]$ such that $F(v, i)$ is the maximum number of leaves that can be chosen from the subtree $T_v$, given the constraint specified in the problem that every leaves are at least $k$ distance apart and the additional constraint that every leaves are at least $i$ from the $v$. The final answer is $F(r, 0)$ where $r$ is the root.

#### Recursive Formula

For base case, if $v \in T$ is a leaf, then $F(v, 0) = 1$ (choosing itself) and $F(v, i) = 0$ for $i > 0$ (only possible choice is itself, yet the distance to itself is $0$ so no possible leaves).

For recurrence, if $v \in T$ is a internal node, then we have its left child $v_L$ and right child $v_R$. $F(v, i)$ is the sum of $F(v_L, j)$ and $F(v_R, \ell)$, for some $j$ and $l$. We need to make sure that the constraint for $T(v, i)$ is still satisfied, therefore $j + \ell \ge k - 2$ so that two leaves in $T_{v_L}$ and $T_{v_R}$ still are at least $k$ apart, and that $\min(j, \ell) \ge i - 1$ so that every leave is still $i$ apart from $v$. Therefore (**the naive version**)
$$
F(v, i) = \max_{
\begin{matrix}
j,\ell \in [0, k] \\
j+\ell \ge k - 2 \\
\min(j, \ell)\ge i -1  
\end{matrix}
} F(v_L , j) + F(v_R, \ell)
$$
But notice that we should notice that $F(v, i)$ is monotonically non-increasing with $i$. (Intuitively, the cases when given constraint that at least $i'$ away from root always include the cases when given constraint that at least away $i$ from root given that $i' < i$) Therefore, we want to make $j + \ell = k - 2$ so that the sub cases could have as small $j$ and $k$ possible therefore bigger $F(v_L, j)$ and $F(v_R, \ell)$. So, a **better** recurrence formula is:
$$
F(v, i) = \max_{
\begin{matrix}
j,\ell \in [0, k] \\
j+\ell = k - 2 \\
\min(j, \ell)\ge i -1  
\end{matrix}
} F(v_L , j) + F(v_R, \ell)
$$

#### Evaluation Order

Since each $F(v, i)$ only depends on its children, we could traverse tree in **post-order** (bottom-up), in each node, we need to evaluate for all $i \in [0, k]$. (Order doesn't matter for $i$, but let's do it in increasing order).

#### Complexity

Since we need to traverse every node, so there are $O(n)$ node. In each node we need to consider $j,\ell$ for $O(k)$ cases (as their sum goes to $k-2$). In each case, the summation only takes $O(1)$ time. In total, it takes $O(nk)$. (If it's the naive approach, it will take $O(nk^2)$ instead). Since we save $F(v, i)$ for all node $v \in T$ and $i \in [0, k]$, it will take $O(nk)$. (Technically, we only need to save the root-to-leaf path which only have $O(h)$ node so the space complexity is $O(hk)$ but in worst case $O(h) = O(n)$, so it doesn't have effect on final space complexity)
