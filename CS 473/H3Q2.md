#### Subproblems

Define $C(i, j, m)$ for indices $1 \le i \le m \le j \le n$ such that $C(i, j, m)$ represents the cost of constructing a proper binary tree using the subsequence $\langle a_i, a_{i+1}, ..., a_j\rangle$ with $a_m$ as the root of the tree. Obviously, the final result is $\sum_{m = 1}^{n} C(0, n, m)$. 

#### Recursive Formula

For base case, if the subsequence has a single element then it is a leaf, and there are no edges so that cost $C(i, i, i) = 0$. If the subsequence has even number of elements, then it is invalid, because you could not construct a proper binary tree from it, so $C(i, i+2k, *) = \infin$ for $k \in \Z$.

For subsequence has odd number of elements (and is more than one element), then we need to pick a element $a_m$ to be the root, then we need to total cost is the cost to construct left subtree (plus an edge) and right subtree (plus an edge):
$$
C(i, j, m) = L(i, m) + R(m,j)
$$
where the cost for left part and right part is:
$$
L(i, m) = \min_{k \in [1, m-1]} C(i, m-1, k) + |a_m - a_k| \\
R(m, j) = \min_{\ell \in [m+1, j]} C(m+1, j, \ell) + |a_m - a_\ell| \\
$$
That is, the minimum for constructing the subtree plus the edge cost.

#### Evaluation Order

We notice that for $C(i, j, m)$, the case depends on case $C(i', j', m')$ where the interval length $L = j - i + 1$ is bigger than $L' = j' - i' + 1$. So, we evaluate all intervals $L \in [1, n]$ in increasing order (we only evaluate odd length as even length is already a base case). For $m$, we evaluate them in $m \in (i, j)$. (We could just evaluate $m$ in any order, but let's evaluate it in increasing order).

#### Complexity

There are $O(n^2)$ intervals for ($i \le i \le j \le m$), for each interval, we evaluate $O(n)$ choices of $m$. For each choice, we iterate over $k$ and $\ell$ so it will take $O(n)$ time. So, in total it will take $O(n^4)$ time. For space complexity, since we are storing for each interval with each choice of $m$, it will take $O(n^3)$ space.
