#### Subproblems

Define $T(i, t_1, t_2, t_3)$ be the **minimum additional waiting time** spent by customer $i, i+1, ..., n$, given that server $1$ have accumulated service time $t_1$. Same goes for server $2$ and $3$â€‹. The output we want is $T(1, 0, 0, 0)$, that is, the minimum additional waiting time spent by customer from $1$ to $n$ (i.e. all waiting time), given that all server have no accumulated time (i.e. all server free from start).

#### Recursive Formula

When all customer are assigned, there is no additional waiting time. So:
$$
T(n+1,t_1, t_2, t_3) = 0 \qquad \forall t_1, t_2, t_3
$$
and if customer from $i$ to $n$ total waiting time is the waiting time for customer $i$ plus the waiting time for customer from $i+1$ to $n$, picking the minimum of customer $i$ choosing different server:
$$
T(i, t_1, t_2, t_3) = \min \begin{cases}
t_1 + T(i + 1, t_1 + \ell_i, t_2, t_3) \\
t_2 + T(i + 1, t_1, t_2 + \ell_i, t_3) \\
t_3 + T(i + 1, t_1, t_2, t_3 + \ell_i) 
\end{cases}
$$
Suppose the customer comes in order from $1$ to $n$, then it should be obvious that waiting time for customer $i$ is $t_j$ if assigned to server $j$, and the corresponding server $j$ will have its service time increased by $\ell_i$.

#### Evaluation Order

Since $T(i, t_1, t_2, t_3)$ depends on bigger $i$, we need to evaluate $i$ from $n$ to $1$, in **decreasing order**. For a given $i$, we need consider all triples $(t_1, t_2, t_3)$ such that $t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = \sum_{j = 1}^{i-1} \ell_j$ as all service time in server equals to the time required by all customers that arrived so far. 

#### Algorithms

##### Optimal value

Declare 4D array $T[n+1, nL, nL, nL]$ to be all $0$. (as the service time for a server could be $nL$ given that $L$ is maximum possible service time for single customer).

For $i: n \to 1$

* For $(t_1, t_2, t_3)$ such that $t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = \sum_{j = 1}^{i-1} \ell_j$

  * $$
    \text{Set} \ T[i, t_1, t_2, t_3] = \min \begin{cases}
    t_1 + T[i + 1, t_1 + \ell_i, t_2, t_3] \\
    t_2 + T[i + 1, t_1, t_2 + \ell_i, t_3] \\
    t_3 + T[i + 1, t_1, t_2, t_3 + \ell_i] 
    \end{cases}
    $$

Return $T[1, 0, 0, 0]$

**Optimal solution**

Define $\text{Reconstruct}(i, t_1, t_2, t_3)$

* If $i > n$, return.
* If $T[i, t_1, t_2, t_3] = t_1 + T[i + 1, t_1 + \ell_i, t_2, t_3]$
  * Output $(i, 1)$
  * $\text{Reconstruct}(i+1, t_1+\ell, t_2, t_3)$
* Else if $T[i, t_1, t_2, t_3] = t_2 + T[i + 1, t_1, t_2 + \ell_i, t_3]$
  * Output $(i,2)$
  * $\text{Reconstruct}(i+1, t_1, t_2+\ell, t_3)$
* Else
  * Output $(i,3)$
  * $\text{Reconstruct}(i+1, t_1, t_2, t_3+\ell)$

Call $\text{Reconstruct}(1, 0, 0, 0)$

#### Complexity

Notice that although we have three parameters for $t_1, t_2, t_3$. The constraint $t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = \sum_{j = 1}^{i-1} \ell_j \le nL$ makes the there are only $O(n^2L^2)$ possible configuration to choose. Given that we also iteration through $i$, the total time complexity is $O(n^3L^2)$. For space complexity, if we only consider the optimal value, then we only need to save previous layer, so to have a space complexity of $O(n^2L^2)$, if we care about optimal solution, then we could still use Hirschberg divide-and-conquer algorithm to reduce the complexity to $O(n^2L^2)$.
