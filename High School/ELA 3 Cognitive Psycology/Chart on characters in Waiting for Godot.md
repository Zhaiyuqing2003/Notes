###### Quote 1

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 4.

> ESTRAGON: Taking off my boot. Did that never happen to you?
>
> VLADIMIR: Boots must be taken off every day, I'm tired telling you that. Why don't you listen to me? 
>
> ESTRAGON: (feebly). Help me!

###### Quote 2

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 6 - 7. 

>ESTRAGON: Our being born?
>
>Vladimir breaks into a hearty laugh which he immediately stifles, his hand pressed to his pubis, his face contorted. 
>
>VLADIMIR: One dare not even laugh any more. 
>
>ESTRAGON: Dreadful privation. 
>
>VLADIMIR: Merely smile. (He smiles suddenly from ear to ear, keeps smiling, ceases as suddenly.) It's not the same thing. Nothing to be done. (Pause.) Gogo.

###### Quote 3

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 19. 

>ESTRAGON: (with effort). Gogo light—bough not break—Gogo dead. Didi heavy—bough break—Didi alone. Whereas—

###### Quote 4

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 5 - 6.

>VLADIMIR: Sometimes I feel it coming all the same. Then I go all queer. (He takes off his hat, peers inside it, feels about inside it, shakes it, puts it on again.) How shall I say? Relieved and at the same time . . . (he searches for the word) . . . appalled. (With emphasis.) AP-PALLED. (He takes off his hat again, peers inside it.) Funny. (He knocks on the crown as though to dislodge a foreign body, peers into it again, puts it on again.) Nothing to be done. (Estragon with a supreme effort succeeds in pulling off his boot. He peers inside it, feels about inside it, turns it upside down, shakes it, looks on the ground to see if anything has fallen out, finds nothing, feels inside it again, staring sightlessly before him.) Well?

###### Quote 5

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 15.

>ESTRAGON: (restored to the horror of his situation). I was asleep! (Despairingly.) Why will you never let me sleep? 
>
>VLADIMIR: I felt lonely. 
>
>ESTRAGON: I had a dream. 
>
>VLADIMIR: Don't tell me!

###### Quote 6

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 27.

>VLADIMIR: Question of temperament. 
>
>ESTRAGON: Of character. 
>
>VLADIMIR: Nothing you can do about it. 
>
>ESTRAGON: No use struggling. 
>
>VLADIMIR: One is what one is. 
>
>ESTRAGON: No use wriggling.
>
>VLADIMIR: The essential doesn't change.

###### Quote 7

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 16 - 17.

>VLADIMIR: Calm yourself. 
>
>ESTRAGON: (voluptuously.) Calm . . . calm . . . The English say cawm. (Pause.) You know the story of the Englishman in the brothel? 
>
>VLADIMIR: Yes. 
>
>ESTRAGON: Tell it to me. 
>
>VLADIMIR: Ah stop it! 
>
>ESTRAGON: An Englishman having drunk a little more than usual proceeds to a brothel. The bawd asks him if he wants a fair one, a dark one or a red-haired one. Go on.

###### Quote 8

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 12.

>VLADIMIR: It must be dead. 
>
>ESTRAGON: No more weeping. 
>
>VLADIMIR: Or perhaps it's not the season. 
>
>ESTRAGON: Looks to me more like a bush. 
>
>VLADIMIR: A shrub. 
>
>ESTRAGON: A bush. 
>
>VLADIMIR: A—. What are you insinuating? That we've come to the wrong place? 
>
>ESTRAGON: He should be here.

###### Quote 9

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 15.

>VLADIMIR: (feebly). All right. (Estragon sits down on the mound. Vladimir paces agitatedly to and fro, halting from time to time to gaze into distance off. Estragon falls asleep. Vladimir halts finally before Estragon.) Gogo! . . . Gogo! . . . GOGO!

###### Quote 10

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 29 - 30.

> ESTRAGON: (timidly, to Pozzo). You're not Mr. Godot, Sir? 
>
> POZZO:(terrifying voice). I am Pozzo! (Silence.) Pozzo! (Silence.) Does that name mean nothing to you? (Silence.) I say does that name mean nothing to you?Vladimir and Estragon look at each other questioningly. 
>
> ESTRAGON: (pretending to search). Bozzo . . . Bozzo . . . 
>
> VLADIMIR: (ditto). Pozzo . . . Pozzo . . .

###### Quote 11

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 28.

>POZZO: (off). On! (Crack of whip. Pozzo appears. They cross the stage. Lucky passes before Vladimir and Estragon and exit. Pozzo at the sight of Vladimir and Estragon stops short. The rope tautens. Pozzo jerks at it violently.) Back!

###### Quote 12

From *Waiting for Godot* by Samuel Beckett, page 32.

>POZZO: (with magnanimous gesture). Let's say no more about it. (He jerks the rope.) Up pig! (Pause.) Every time he drops he falls asleep. (Jerks the rope.) Up hog! (Noise of Lucky getting up and picking up his baggage. Pozzo jerks the rope.) Back! (Enter Lucky backwards.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Turn! (Lucky turns. To Vladimir and Estragon, affably.) Gentlemen, I am happy to have met you. (Before their incredulous expression.) Yes yes, sincerely happy. (He jerks the rope.) Closer! (Lucky advances.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Yes, the road seems long when one journeys all alone for . . . (he consults his watch) . . . yes . . . (he calculates) . . . yes, six hours, that's right, six hours on end, and never a soul in sight. (To Lucky.) Coat! (Lucky puts down the bag, advances, gives the coat, goes back to his place, takes up the bag.) Hold that! (Pozzo holds out the whip. Lucky advances and, both his hands being occupied, takes the whip in his mouth, then goes back to his place. Pozzo begins to put on his coat, stops.) Coat! (Lucky puts down the bag, basket and stool,helps Pozzo on with his coat, goes back to his place and takes up bag, basket and stool.) Touch of autumn in the air this evening. (Pozzo finishes buttoning up his coat, stoops, inspects himself, straightens up.) Whip! (Lucky advances, stoops, Pozzo snatches the whip from his mouth, Lucky goes back to his place.) Yes, gentlemen, I cannot go for long without the society of my likes (he puts on his glasses and looks at the two likes) even when the likeness is an imperfect one. (He takes off his glasses.) Stool! (Lucky puts down bag and basket, advances, opens stool, puts it down, goes back to his place, takes up bag and basket.) Closer! (Lucky puts down bag and basket, advances, moves stool, goes back to his place, takes up bag and basket. Pozzo sits down, places the butt of his whip against Lucky's chest and pushes.) Back! (Lucky takes a step back.) Further! (Lucky takes another step back.) Stop! (Lucky stops. To Vladimir and Estragon.) That is why, with your permission, I propose to dally with you a moment, before I venture any further. Basket! (Lucky advances, gives the basket, goes back to his place.) The fresh air stimulates the jaded appetite. (He opens the basket, takes out a piece of chicken and a bottle of wine.) Basket! (Lucky advances, picks up the basket and goes back to his place.) Further! (Lucky takes a step back.) He stinks. Happy days!
