Plasticity, physical part changed , worse if older.

specific part -> specific function

information <--> Senses (sight, taste, ..)

Systems & Subsystems 

Chemical & Electric

<-- Learn from natural damage

Lesion --> Tissue destruction (Natural or experimental) on brain

BEG -> read brain electricity,  amplified electric reading

MEG -> read brain magneticity,  amplified magnetic reading

CT -> x-ray brain photography

PET -> reads brain consumption of fuel glucose, radioactive glucose.. More glucose -> More activity

MRI -> magnetic resonance imaging , radio-wave, magnetic -> Soft tissues.

fMRI -> blood flow <-- a series of picture. More blood flow -> More activity.



Brainstem --> no consciousness needed

Pons, Movement & Sleep

Medulla, Heart beat & Breath

Thalamus <-> sensory control center 

Reticular Formation --> Rousal 

Cerebellum --> Non-verbal learning, skill memory. Coordinate movement.  

The limbic system: Emotion, drives (Dopamine)

Limbic -> Limbus

Amygdala -> Aggression and Fear -> Felicity 

Hypothalamus Brain <--> Command Chain.

Hippocampus --> memory

Cerebrum --> Main brain

Cortex Structure

Frontal Lobes

​	Executive Function

​	Emotional Control

​	Planning

Prefrontal Cortex

Parietal Lobes -> Motor 

Temporal Lobes

Occipital Lobes -> Sight
