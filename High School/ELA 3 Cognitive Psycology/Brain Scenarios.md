# Brain Scenarios

> Walking down a dark New York street late at night you suddenly feel the metal barrel of a pistol press against your head behind your ear and hear the instructions “Don’t move a muscle while I slip your wallet out of your pocket.” Unfortunately you do move, the gun is fired and the bullet enters the brain. Breathing and heart beat stop almost immediately. Where is the bullet?

**The brainstem, Medulla. According to the PPT, the Medulla controls the heartbeat and breathing.** 

>Little Mo” was extremely short for his age. His doctors concluded his brain was not stimulating the proper release of hormones necessary for growth. What area of the brain are they probably focusing on?

**Limbic System, Hypothalamus. According to the PPT, hypothalamus reads blood chemistry and orders from other brain regions, and secrete hormones.**

> You’re in a parking lot at 2 AM when a guy in a hockey mask holding a long-bladed knife jumps out at you. What system of nerves would arouse your body to action?

**Limbic System, Amygdala. According to the PPT, amygdala linked to aggression and fear. You will fear in this scenario, and run away.  Amygdala makes you fear.**

>On Justin’s 21st birthday he & his buddies celebrated a bit too much. When the police stopped his car Justin’s speech was slurred, he couldn’t walk a straight line or balance on one foot. He nearly missed his face altogether when asked to touch his nose while his eyes were closed. The impaired functioning of what part of Justin’s brain is responsible for these difficulties with motor coordination and balance?

**Cerebellum and pons from the Brainstem. According to the PPT, the Cerebellum and pons coordinate voluntary movement. (Motor cortex might also be involved)** 

>Uncle Ed suffered a stroke which damaged a portion of his cortex. He shows some weakness and partial paralysis of his right leg. What area of his cortex was affected by the stroke? 

**Frontal Lobes, According to PPT, frontal lobes involved in speaking, voluntary muscle movements, and damaging it could cause paralysis.**

>Paul suffered from encephalitis (a brain infection) while in college. He received good medical attention but still the infection took its toll on certain parts of his brain, so that now Paul cannot store new long-term memories. What part of the brain did the encephalitis damage?

**Temporal Lobes. According to PPT, temporal lobes encodes long-term visual and declarative memories by communicating with the hippocampus and amygdala, and damage it could result in impaired factual and long-term memory.**

>Leon’s car was broadsided by a truck causing Leon’s head to smash against the driver’s side window damaging his temporal lobe. What ability may be affected?

**The ability to store long-term memory, understand spoken language, identify and categorize objects, talk persistently, and recognizing faces, and form long-term memory. (From PPT). Because Temporal Lobe process complex visual stimuli, encodes long-term visual and declarative memories, and process auditory information through the primary auditory cortex**

>Jeff suffered serious injuries when his car crashed but he was still able to crawl out of the car and pull his sister out as well. Name one of the transmitters that helped him function in this situation and tell how.

**Endorphin, Endorphin could relieve pain, which helped him to pull his sister out as well.**

>Philip is hooked on cocaine. What neurotransmitter seems most closely related to the pleasure such drugs produce and their addictive qualities?

**Dopamine. Dopamine is one of the neurotransmitters of the reward center of the brain. Cocaine could cause the secretion of dopamine.**

>Grandma Mary had a stroke which impaired her ability to speak fluently although she can move all the necessary muscles. What is the most likely location of her brain damage?

**Frontal Lobes, According to PPT, damaging could result in difficulty in expressing fluent language.**

> Gwen’s brain has a congenital anomaly (a difference in brain anatomy that she was born with) - it lacks the main connection between the right and left hemispheres.  What was Gwen born without?

**According to the definition from PPT, two hemispheres are connected through the Corpus Callosum.** 

>Sara’s grandfather has developed Alzheimer’s disease.  What can you tell her about probable changes in his brain chemistry?

**The Hippocampus might decrease in size, and the temporal lobes might have a decreased functionality in encodes long-term visual and declarative memories.**

>You’re taking a short cut through a back yard to get to your car and encounter two unrestrained Dobermans who begin pursuit.  You run faster than you have ever run before, and dive into your car just in the nick of time.  It takes 10 minutes for your pulse and breathing to slow down to normal.  What part of the nervous system slows heart rate and breathing down to normal afterwards?

**Directly, the medulla from brainstem which controls breathing and heartbeat. Parasympathetic system**

>Amy was having a really bad week.  On Monday her vision got blurrier and blurrier until she could no longer see at all.  On Tuesday she found she couldn’t hear.  On Wednesday her sense of taste went.  On Thursday she lost her sense of touch.  Her CAT scan revealed a single brain tumor was probably producing all of these deficits.  What single part of the brain in involved in all of these sensory processes?>
>

**Thalamus, because it receives information from all senses except smell.**


>Pete was struck by lightening when he insisted on finishing his 18 holes of golf despite the lightening packed thunderstorm.  He was looking down; lining up a long putt shot and the bolt of lightening struck the rear of his head, frying his occipital lobes.  What aspect of behavior is likely to be impaired if Pete survives?

**He might have difficulty with locating objects in an environment, difficulty identifying colors, hallucinations, visual illusions, word blindness (inability to recognize words), difficulty in recognizing drawn objects, inability to recognize movement of an object, difficulty reading and writing. (From PPT)**

>Dana is taking Prozac to help control her depression.  Prozac works by increasing the availability of what neurotransmitter?

**Serotonin, Prozac could increase availability of Serotonin, which is considered to be one of the neurotransmitters that bring happiness. **

> Margie suffered damage to part of the surface of her brain after being struck by a golf club let loose by an irate golfer.  As a result Margie has lost some sensory awareness of her left leg.  Where is Margie’s brain damage (be specific).

**Parietal Lobes, Parietal Lobes integrates the sensory input and constructs spatial coordinate system to represent the world, and damage it might cause the lack of awareness of certain body parts.**

>After falling through the ice on a local pond Johnny was trapped under the icy water for 10 minutes before the rescuers got him out.  They were able to resuscitate his pulse and breathing but he did not regain consciousness for days.  Disturbance of what specific part of Johnny’s brain might have resulted in an inability of the brain to regulate normal alertness?

**Reticular Formation, which helps control arousal. The inability of the brain to regulate normal alertness might be caused by the impairing of the Reticular Formation.** 

>Jeanette suffers from focal epilepsy (seizures localized in just one part of the brain).  Her seizures are triggering extreme emotions- most often extreme fear followed by a rage response.  What part of the brain is being affected?

**Amygdala, it's linked to aggression and fear. Her seizures might affect the Amygdala.**

>After Martin’s car accident he had difficulty understanding what others were saying to him.  He could speak but what he said made little sense.  Where is Martin’s brain damage?

**Damage of temporal lobes, for the damage of it can result in difficulty in understanding spoken words and persistent talking.**
