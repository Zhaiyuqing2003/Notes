# Question

Why Data is sentient or not and what that means for our understanding of sentience. 

In the TV show, the Data are asked to do a experimental to clone more android like him. The theoretical backbone of the experimental is not very reliable, and the captain / Data decide to resign to avoid the experiment. But if the Data is a **property**, he will have no rights. **The main concentration of the TV shows is whether Data is a sentient being or not.** 

The plays indicates that **Data is of course a robot, a machine**, but the captain also proved that human is also machine, a machine that just in different form. And the most important is **that we need to determine whether Data is a sentient being.** The scientists there argues that the **sentient = intelligent + self-awareness + consciousness.** It's easy to prove that the Data is intelligent, and he is self-awareness by the multiple use of "I" in his sentence. But it's difficult to **define "consciousness"**, because we couldn't find a certain objective criteria for "consciousness". So, **if we using this criteria**, we are hard to even tell if human are sentient, and to distinguish between human and robots. 

So, just considering the appearance, the Data looks no major difference as a human, but it's impossible to tell whether Data, or even human, is sentient. Our common understanding of consciousness is unreliable and subjectively, we might need a better definition.
