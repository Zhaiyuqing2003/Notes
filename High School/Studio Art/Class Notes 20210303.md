Melting clock --> Melting time --> Time is distorted, time is passed --> The inaccuracy of the memory, the past.

Surrealism --> Dream on canvas

Frozen things <-- Mirage --> Time is illusion

Fly ---> Time "fly"

Fly ---> Decayed, Rotten --> Memory, Time is rotten. 

Orange Pocket watch --> Looks like candy --> Time is sweet, precious.

Wooden table, trees. --> You cut trees to make wooden box, but tree grows on the wooden table! (Irony)

Time <--> Saddle on the horse --> Controlled by time --> Inevitable mortality.
