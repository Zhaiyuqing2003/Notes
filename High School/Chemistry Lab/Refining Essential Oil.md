# Refining Essential Oil

## Introduction

> An **essential oil** is a concentrated [hydrophobic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophobic) liquid containing [volatile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(chemistry)) (easily evaporated at normal temperatures) [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound) from [plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plant)[^Wikipedia]

This experiment tends to make **citrus peel essential oil**, which has pleasant scent.

## Research Design

### Method

This experiment will use **distillation** to extract the essential oil. The citrus peel will be boiled in the water, and the vapor will be condensed and then collected. 

The reason behind this method is that the **boiling point of water and essential oil is different.** Water has $100^\circ C$ boiling point, while the  **citrus peel essential oil** has approximately $80^\circ C$ boiling point. By controlling the temperature, the highly concentrated essential oil could be collected.

### Equipment

Scissor -- to cut **citrus peel** into pieces.

Thermometer -- to control the temperature.

Alcohol lamp, Wire gauze, Ring Stand -- used for heating.

Florence flask -- put the citrus peel into it.

Rubber stoppers -- plug on the end of Florence flask. 

Zeolite -- used to prevent bumping and liquid flooding.

Still head, Condenser -- used to collect and condense vapor.

Erlenmeyer flask -- used to collect condensed essential oil.

Separatory Funnel -- used to separate hydrolat and essential oil.

## Procedure

1. Set up the equipment as the picture below. Make sure all equipment is checked and calibrated for experiments. (Notice the two ends of the condenser, this setup could make sure that the hot air leaves and cold air comes in quicker than other way.)

2. Use scissor to cut **citrus peel** into pieces, put them into Florence flask, add sufficient amount of water into the flask along with **Zeolite**.
3. Ignite the alcohol burner. Control the distance between the alcohol burner and the flask, so that the vapor could be controlled in desired temperature.  (As indicated by thermometer)
4. Boil the **Citrus peel** until the essential oils comes out from the condenser almost disappears. Then use separatory funnel to separate the essential oil.
