## 2. Making Solution

### a

> $\ce{20 mL 10\% Na2CO3 }$

$$
\ce{
	\frac{x}{20 + x} = 0.10
}
$$

$$
\ce{
	x = \frac{0.10 * 20}{0.90} = 2.2 g
}
$$

Use balance that are accurate at least to $\ce{1g}$. Weigh $\ce{2.2g Na2CO3}$, Use $\ce{25 mL}$ graduated flask that are accurate at least to $\ce{10 mL}$ to get $\ce{20 mL}$ distilled water. Put the solid into a $\ce{25 mL}$ beaker first, than put distilled water in. Use glass rod to stir the solution until the solid is fully dissolved. Transferred the solution into a large enough dropping bottle.

### b

> $\ce{100 mL 3M H2SO4 from 18.4M H2SO4}$

$$
\ce{
	V = \frac{0.100L * 3M}{18.4 M} = 0.02L = 2 * 10 mL
}
$$

Use $\ce{25 mL}$ graduated flask that are accurate at least to $\ce{10 mL}$ to get $\ce{20 mL 18.4 M H2SO4}$. Prepare $\ce{50 mL}$ beaker, add small amount of distilled water first into it, than slowly add acid into it, use glass rod to direct the acid if necessary. Then, transfer the solution into the volumetric flask, and add distilled water into it until it reached $\ce{100 mL}$, use dropper to be accurate. Transferred the solution into a large enough dropping bottle.

### c

> $\ce{100 mL 3M HCl from 12M HCl}$

$$
\ce{
	V = \frac{0.100L * 3M}{12 M} = 0.03L = 3 * 10 mL
}
$$

Use $\ce{50 mL}$ graduated flask that are accurate at least to $\ce{10 mL}$ to get $\ce{30 mL 12 M HCl}$. Prepare $\ce{50 mL}$ beaker, add small amount of distilled water first into it, than slowly add acid into it, use glass rod to direct the acid if necessary. Then, transfer the solution into the volumetric flask, and add distilled water into it until it reached $\ce{100 mL}$, use dropper to be accurate. Transferred the solution into a large enough dropping bottle.

### d

> $\ce{20 mL 25\% KSCN }$

$$
\ce{
	\frac{x}{10 + x} = 0.25
}
$$

$$
\ce{
	x = \frac{0.25 * 10}{0.75} = 3.3 g
}
$$

Use balance that are accurate at least to $\ce{1g}$. Weigh $\ce{3.3g  KSCN}$, Use $\ce{25 mL}$ graduated flask that are accurate at least to $\ce{10 mL}$ to get $\ce{20 mL}$ distilled water. Put the solid into a $\ce{25 mL}$ beaker first, than put distilled water in. Use glass rod to stir the solution until the solid is fully dissolved. Transferred the solution into a large enough dropping bottle.

### e

$$
\ce{
	n_{Fe^{3+}} = \frac{0.1000g/L * 1.000L}{55.85g/mol} = 0.001791mol 
}
$$

$$
\ce{
	m = n_{Fe^{3+}} * M = 0.8634g
}
$$

Use balance with accuracy of $\ce{0.001g}$. Weigh $\ce{0.8634g}$ solid. Put the solid into a $\ce{100 mL}$ beaker, than add distilled water. Use glass rod to stir the solution until it's dissolved. Transferred the solution into the $\ce{1000 mL}$ volumetric flask. Wash the beaker with distilled water for three times, then add put the water that washed the beaker into the volumetric flask. Add additional water to volumetric flask until it reached $\ce{1000 mL}$. Use dropper for accuracy. Then transfer the solution into a large enough dropping bottle.
