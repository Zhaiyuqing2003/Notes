# Beer's Law

## 1

> A student is instructed to determine the concentration of a solution of $\ce{COCl2}$ based on absorption of light (spectrometric/colorimetric method). The student is provided with $\ce{0.10M}$ solution of $\ce{CoCl2}$ with which to prepare standard solutions with concentration of $\ce{0.020M, 0.040M, 0.060M, and 0.080M}$.

### (a)

> Describe the procedure for diluting the $\ce{0.10M}$ solution to a concentration of $\ce{0.020M}$ using distilled water, a $\ce{100 mL}$ volumetric flask, and a pipet or beret. Include specific amounts where appropriate.

**Answer:**
$$
\ce{
	V = \frac{0.020M * 0.100L}{0.10M} = 0.020L = 20 mL
}
$$
Use $\ce{25 mL}$ **Graduated Pipet** to move $\ce{20 mL}$ solution to the volumetric flask. Use the distilled water to wash the remanent into the flask, and add additional water until the solution in the volumetric flask  reached $\ce{100 mL}$, use dropper if necessary.

> The student takes the $\ce{0.10M}$ solution and determines the percent transmittance and the absorbance at various wavelengths. The two graphs below represent the data.

### (b)

> Identify the optimum wavelength for the analysis

Approximately 510 nm.

> The student measures the absorbance of the $\ce{0.020 M, 0.040M, 0.060M, 0.080M. 0.10M}$ solutions. The data are plotted below.

### (c)

> The absorbance of the unknown solution is 0.275. What is the concentration of the solution?

Approximately 0.50.

### (d)

> Beer's Law is an expression that includes three factors that determine the amount of light that passes through a solution. Identify two of these factors.

(1) the characteristic of the matter itself. 

(2) the length of the light travel through.

(3) the wavelength of the light.

### （e)

> The student handles the sample container (e.g., test tube or cuvette) that holds the unknown solution and leaves fingerprints in the path of the light beam. How will this affect the calculated concentration of the unknown? Explain your answer.

The fingerprint will increase the Absorbance. Therefore, the calculated concentration will be bigger than the actual one. 

### (f)

> Why is this method of determining the concentration of $\ce{CoCl2}$ solution appropriate, whereas using the same method for measuring the concentration of $\ce{NaCl}$ solution would not be appropriate?

Because the $\ce{NaCl}$ solution is transparent and no color.

## 2

> A students carries out an experiment to determine the equilibrium constant for a reaction by colorimetric (spectrophotometric) analysis. The production of the red-colored species $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}}(aq)$ is monitored. 

### (a)

> The optimum wavelength for the measurement of $\ce{[FeSCN^{2+}]}$ must first be determined. The plot of absorbance, $\ce{A}$, versus wavelength, $\ce{\lambda}$ for the $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}}$ is given below. What is the optimum wavelength for this experiment? Justify your answer.

It's approximately 450 nm. According to the definition of optimal wavelength, under other circumstances is unchanged, the wavelength that have greatest absorbance is the optimal absorbance.

### (b)

> A calibration plot for the concentration of $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}(aq)}$ is prepared at the optimum wavelength. The data below give the absorbance measured for a set of solutions of known concentration of $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}}$ 

| Concentration $\ce{mol L^{-1}}$ | Absorbance |
| ------------------------------- | ---------- |
| $1.1 * 10^{-4}$                 | 0.030      |
| $3.0 * 10^{-4}$                 | 0.065      |
| $8.0 * 10^{-4}$                 | 0.160      |
| $12 * 10^{-4}$                  | 0.239      |
| $\ce{18 * 10^{-4}}$             | 0.340      |

#### (i) 

> Draw a Beer's law calibration plot of all the data on the grid below. Indicate the scale on the horizontal axis by labeling it with appropriate values.

#### (ii)

> An $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}(aq)}$ solution of unknown concentration has an absorbance of 0.300. Use the plot you drew in part (i) to determine the concentration, in moles per liter, of this solution.

Approximately $\ce{0.0016 M}$

### c

> The purpose of the experiment is to determine the equilibrium constant for the reaction represented below.
> $$
> \ce{
> 	Fe^{3+}(aq) + SCN-(aq) <=> FeSCN^{2+}(aq)
> }
> $$

#### (i)

> Write the equilibrium-constant expression for $\ce{K_c}$

$$
\ce{
	K_c = \frac{[FeSCN^{2+}]}{[SCN-][Fe^{3+}]}
}
$$

#### (ii)

> The student combines solutions of $\ce{Fe(NO3)3}$ and $\ce{KSCN}$ to produce a solution in which the initial concentrations of $\ce{Fe^{3+}(aq)}$ and $\ce{SCN-(aq)}$ are both $\ce{6.0 * 10^{-3} M}$. The absorbance of this solution is measured, and the equilibrium $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}(aq)}$ concentration is found to be $\ce{1.0 * 10^{-3} M}$. Determine the value of $\ce{K_c}$ 

$$
\ce{
	[Fe^{3+}] = [SCN-] = 6.0 * 10^{-3} M - 1.0 * 10^{-3} M = 5.0 * 10^{-3} M
}
$$

$$
\ce{
	K_c = \frac{[FeSCN^{2+}]}{[SCN-][Fe^{3+}]} = \frac{1.0 * 10^{-3}}{(5.0 * 10^{-3})^2} = 40
}
$$

### (d)

> If the student's equilibrium $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}(aq)}$ solution of unknown concentration fades to a lighter color before the student measures its absorbance, will the calculated value of $\ce{K_c}$ be too high, too low, or unaffected? Justify your answer.

It will decrease the absorbance, and in turn decrease measured concentration of $\ce{FeSCN^{2+}}$. Thus, the calculated $\ce{[Fe^{3+}] and  [SCN-]}$ will become bigger, and the resulting $\ce{K_c}$ will become smaller.
