## Discrimination

In summary, the admission of Harvard uses different SAT standards for Asian-Americans, along with an unfounded negative rating for personality qualities. 

This is **discrimination**. According to the definition in the book, it is a "negative behavior toward members of out-groups". In the news, Harvard uses higher SAT standards for Asians (out-groups), which lower the number of Asians admitted despite higher average performance unjustly (negative behavior).

This discrimination probably originated from the **stereotype** that Asians are more intelligent, so higher standards should be used. The negative rating for personality might come from the **prejudice** that Asians are usually more introverted and act more like "nerds". According to the gender discrimination in U.S. orchestras and its solutions, the applications process in which applicants' identities are kept secrets might be helpful.

## Deindividuation

This is a phenomenon of **deindividuation**. When in the stadium, they become part of " fans" that "fight" for their teams rather than a single individual (stripped of usual identities), and thus they shoot fans for different teams (uncharacteristic behaviors), according to the definition in the book.

The individuation is more likely to happen in the stadium because the crowd provides anonymity for the individuals and lessens the person's responsibility for stopping such behavior, according to the book. In this case, the irrational behavior might be less likely to be stopped, and the person was less likely to be found due to anonymity. Also, the aggression might be induced because of the frustration of seeing the loss of their favored teams. 

## Just-world Hypothesis

Source: [The Just World Theory](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/ethics-resources/ethical-decision-making/the-just-world-theory/). The beginning of this article mentioned that a woman was raped, but the jury showed little sympathy because they think she deserved that. The rapist was acquitted.

This is a clear example of **the Just-world hypothesis**. The victim is blamed for wearing improperly and seducing the rapist because the jury wants to believe that the "world is fair" rather than helping the victim.

Here, the way of thinking as "the world is fair" is because people tend to think of others' dispositional factors rather than situational factors. In this case, the jury made the **fundamental attribution error** about the victim or even the **ultimate attribution error** about all the women, they may think that women are raped was because they're sexually immoral.

## Social Contagion

In summary, New York's stock market melted up 3 times in March 2020 because of the coronavirus.

This is a phenomenon of **social contagion**, in the outbreak of coronavirus, it's highly uncertain to predict the stock market. (the situation is ambiguous), and once someone started to sell their stocks, others followed (Followed others' behavior), which is consistent with the definition of social contagion.

Social contagion usually happened in the stock market, especially under some dramatic social events. The first reason is that it's highly uncertain, especially under uncertain and dramatic social events like coronavirus. Secondly, the melting down of the stock market is fueled by anxiety. Those two reasons facilitate social contagion in the stock market. Social contagion, which could lead to mass hysteria, also happened during the outbreak of coronavirus. An example is that people bought all toilet paper in the store, who feared shortage of goods.
