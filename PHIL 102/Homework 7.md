#### Exercise 7.1

1. An argument. It uses **method of difference**. It could be easily spotted as an casual inference, and the difference is the application of the antibiotic and the symptom on the ear infection.

  (P1) Without antibiotic, my ear infection persist and are painful.

  (P2) With antibiotic, infection clears up quickly and pain goes away.

  (C) The antibiotic causes the infection to clear up (and the pain to stop)

2. An argument. It uses **inductive generalization**. From sampled cattle with routinely antibiotic injection to whole population with antibiotic injection.

  (P1) Sampled cattle herds routinely dosed with antibiotics have high chance of support populations of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

  (P2) Sampled herds is not special (i.e. representative to whole population)

  (C1*) Cattle herds within this country with this routine applied will have resistance bacteria.

  (P3) The routine is pervasive 

  (C2) Resistance bacteria are likely being produced in cattle herds within this country.

3. An argument. It uses **statistical syllogism**. Although "cure" is a casual term, but the cause is not what focused here.

  (P1) A does of antibiotics typically cures an ear infection in a couple of days.

  (P2) You apply the antibiotics on your ear infection today,

  (C) You will be cured in two days.

4. An argument. It uses **argument from analogy**. Analogy between my opinion / feeling on the pastries.

   (P1) I feel that gluten-free pastries don't have the nice crumbly texture that regular ones do.

   (P2*) I will choose the pastries that has crumbly texture

   (P3**) You probably have same opinion about pastries to me

   (C) You should choose regular pastries.

5. An argument. It uses **argument from analogy**. Analogy between tomorrow to previous days. (Not a statistical syllogism, because tomorrow is not in the population of previously recorded days)

   (P1) Sun has come up roughly every 24 hours throughout recorded history.

   (P2*) Tomorrow is similar to the previous days.

   (C) Sun will be up at about the usual time tomorrow.

6. An argument. It uses **argument from analogy**. Analogy between the Christmas tree in previous year and this year.

   (P1) Christmas tree in previous year kept its foliage really well over the entire Christmas period.

   (P2) Christmas tree we get this year had a nice bluish tinge to it like the previous one.

   (C) This tree will probably keep its foliage too.

7. An argument. It uses **inference to best explanation**. It gives two explanations (earth-centric and that earth self-rotate). It rules out the former and reach the latter explanation.

   (P1) The sun has come up roughly every 24 hours through recorded history.

   (P2) The sun does not orbit stationary earth.

   (C) Only possible explanation is that earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours.

8. An argument. It uses **inductive generalization**. It reaches the conclusion that water is conductor of electricity by stating many cases that shows this.

   (P1) Lab experiments have shown that water is a good conductor of electricity.

   (P2) Many people have been electrocuted walking through a flooded basement with power left on.

   (C) Water is a good conductor of electricity.

9. An argument. It uses **inductive generalization**. It generalize the sample (past days) to whole population (any day).

   (P1) Sun has come up roughly every 24 hours throughout recorded history.

   (C) Sun will do so eternally.

10. An argument. It uses **statistical syllogism**. It assumes that these symptom under current time period correlates highly to mumps.

    (P1) You have symptoms like swollen glands, headache, fatigue, and pain when swallowing.

    (P2) Mumps is going around currently.

    (P3*) In current time period, having symptoms like above typically indicates that you have mumps

    (C) You have mumps

11. It's just an explanation of how normal water conducts electricity.

12. An argument. It uses **method of difference**. The difference in coffee intake causes the difference in sleep quality.

    (P1) Every time I have coffee after 9 P.M, I have a problem getting a good night's sleep

    (P2*) Coffee has psychoactive contents caffeine.

    (C) Caffeine badly affects the quality of sleep if it's drink after 9 P.M.

13. An argument. It uses **inference to best explanation**. He could either do (1) real test (2) fabricate data. The premise used eliminate the first probability.

    (P1) His quality control reports says that exactly 3% of the sampled toys are defective.

    (P2) Real data could not be uniform in that way.

    (C) He might fabricate all the data

14. An argument. It uses **argument from analogy**. Analogy of the current boyfriends to previous boyfriends.

    (P1) Current boy friends is just like all previous friends

    (P2*) Previous boyfriends' relation is ended.

    (C) This relationship isn't going to work either.

#### Exercise 7.2

>Should parents educate their children at home.    
>
>In Britain some parents are now choosing to educate their children at home. This is often because some children find it difficult to fit into the school system because they are especially gifted or have problems of some kind. However, despite the various arguments that have been put forward for home tutoring, this essay will argue that it is better for a child to be educated at school.
>
>Teaching children at home has a number of advantages. Firstly, parents feel that their children will be able to realise their potential better if they can work at their own rate and concentrate on specific subjects. For example, there have been cases of children who have gone to university as young as twelve or thirteen because they are especially gifted and have opted out of the school system. Parents feel that they will also be able to protect their children from harmful influences they may encounter at school if they keep them at home. Problems such as truancy and drugs are common and adolescents particularly can be led astray by their peers. Thus, school can prevent learning from taking place effectively.
>
>However, there are also arguments in support of sending children to school rather than educating them at home. First of all, children are isolated at home. At school, on the other hand, they are able to socialise and meet people of different ages and so become increasingly independent. Children also need their peers to do subjects like sports and drama. Another important point is that schools have more resources and equipment than can be provided at home such as libraries, sports equipment and laboratories for science experiments. A final argument is that school can offer a much wider range of subjects and expertise than parents can provide on their own. Parents would need to have a whole range of professional knowledge in science subjects like physics and chemistry to English literature and economics. It is also questionable whether parents could keep a disciplined study atmosphere at home because of the friendly family atmosphere. In sum, home tuition can affect social independence and fail to provide the correct resources and professional teaching.
>
>To sum up, it seems that education at school is preferable to learning at home. Although home education aids concentration and protection, it limits socialising, availability of resources and professional teaching. There may be particular cases where home tutoring would be advantageous, such as for severely disabled children; however, for the vast majority of children there are greater benefits from going to school.   

Education at school is preferable to learning at home

  1. Children could become increasingly independent
     * they are able to socialize and meet people of different ages
  2. Schools offer necessary peer interactions for certain subjects. (like sports and drama)
  
  3. Schools have more resources and equipment than can be provided at home

>The idea that every citizen should  have the right to a free school or university is widely disputed.  However, those who had disagreed point to substantial government costs  when such laws are enacted. Although, I think that not charging people for education could be a massive benefit to the country and its economy.
>
>First of all, young people from low-income families can be brilliant. Looking back at the history and life stories of prominent people raised in  poverty can illustrate this. Making the school available only to the  lucky ones is wrong. 
>
>In addition, this situation will hurt the  community’s well-being as there will be a shortage of skilled professionals whose skills can be discovered and developed with appropriate training.
>
>Another benefit of making education accessible is national happiness. The inability of people to save enough to pay for school or university expenses causes stress and anxiety in the middle class that can prevent them from even having children. This clearly illustrates that even the inhabitants of wealthier nations do not feel the need to produce their future offspring with proper education.
>
>In the end, nothing seems more economically viable than an intelligent nation. Free courses and learning programs can prepare the best  professionals who can bring profit to themselves and their country. That will close the government’s budget for free education.
>
>To sum up, making all schools free can be very costly for the national  economy, the benefits are significant. After the first few years, such  developments will bring joy to the nation.

Not charging people for education could be a massive benefit to the country and its economy.

  4. **Causal Narrative**

     (P1) If there is no free education, people will be unable to save enough to pay for school or university expenses

     (P2) If above is true, then it could causes stress and anxiety in the middle class

     (P3) Such can prevent them from even having children

     (C) If there is no free education, it could prevent middle-class from even having children

  6. **Casual Narrative**

     (P1) Free courses and learning programs can prepare the best professionals.

     (P2) Best professionals can bring profit to themselves and their country.

     (P3) The profit brought could close the government's budget for free education

     (C*) There will be no budget cost for free education
