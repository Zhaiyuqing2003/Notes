Exercises 0.3

1. Not an argument
2. An argument

(P) Only Pangolins have scales like that.

(C) That’s a pangolin.

 

According to definitions provided by Oxford Languages. 

“An African and Asian mammal that has a body covered with horny overlapping scales, a small head with elongated snout, a long sticky tongue for catching ants and termites, and a thick, tapering tail.”

So, the premise that “it has scales” at least fits one feature of Pangolin, so the premise indicates that the conclusion is more probable, or maybe more likely to be true, though this premise doesn’t not necessarily 100% make that a pangolin. (it’s an argument, but not a good one though).

 

3. Not an argument
4. Not an argument
5. An argument

(P) Some mushrooms that look like that are deadly poisonous.

(C) You shouldn’t eat that.

 

The premise shows that the mushroom that the person about to eat is deadly poisonous, which means the mushrooms could cause death, if that person eats it. As common sense implied here, no one wants to die. So, it’s reasonable to avoid eating that mushroom. (Which supports the conclusion)

 

6. An argument

(P1) If you keep driving like this, you’re going to get into an accident.

(P2) And anyway, it’s very hard on the car.

(C) You should slow down and quit driving like such a jerk!

 

The first premise shows that “driving like this” will cause an accident, which threatens the person’s life. The second premise shows that “driving like this” is more likely to cause problems in the car, which could increase the repair fee for the car in the future. As common sense implied, no one wants to die, and no one wants to spend more money. So, it’s reasonable to slow down, if the premise holds. (Which supports the conclusion)

1. Valid, Sound
2. Valid, Not Sound
3. Not Valid, Not Sound
4. Valid, Not Sound
5. Not Valid, Not Sound
6. Not Valid, Not Sound
7. Valid, Not Sound
8. Not Valid, Not Sound
9. Valid, Sound
10. Valid, Not Sound
11. Valid, Sound
12. Valid, Sound (The average cost per mile of driving a car is $0.58, according to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), so this premise should be close enough to consider as true)
13. Valid, Not Sound
14. Invalid, Not Sound

C.

a.   Valid

b.   It’s still valid, validity doesn’t change whether your premise is true or not. If such a cure could be given to John before the cancer kills him, then the premise (the first line) would become false, and the argument would no longer be sound.

c.   It’s still valid, a valid argument can have false conclusion. It’s not sound now. Since our valid argument shows that (If John has pancreatic cancer, then he will be dead within 12 months. AND John has pancreatic cancer.) THEN (John will be dead within 12 months.). So, the contrapositive is also valid. Also, since we know that John survives more than 12 months, that means either a. (If John has pancreatic cancer, then he will be dead within 12 months) is not true, or b. (John has pancreatic cancer) is not true, or both or the premise is not true. Since at least one premise is not true, that argument is not sound.

1. Impossible, by definition “A sound argument is a valid argument with all true premises.”, if it’s invalid, it must be not sound.
2. Possible. The Eiffel tower is in Berlin. Berlin is in Germany. So, the Eiffel tower is in Germany.
3. Possible. The Eiffel tower is in France. Paris is in France. So, the Eiffel tower is in Paris.
4. Possible. The Eiffel tower is in Berlin. Berlin is in Germany. So, the Eiffel tower is in Germany.
5. Possible. The Eiffel tower is in France. Paris is in France. So, the Eiffel tower is in Paris.
6. Impossible. Sound argument is valid argument and has true premises. A valid argument will guarantee that if the premises are all true, the conclusion will be true. So, the sound argument will have true conclusion. 
7. Possible. The Eiffel tower is in France. Paris is in France. So, the Eiffel tower is in Paris.
8. Possible. The Eiffel tower is in France. Paris is in France. So, the Eiffel tower is in Paris.
9. Possible. The Eiffel tower is in Berlin. Berlin is in France. So, the Eiffel tower is in France.
10. Possible. Copper is a metal. All electrical conductors are metals. So, copper is an electrical conductor. *(“*All electrical conductors are metals.” This premise is false, silicon could also be conductors)

Exercise 1.2

A.   

1. Physical Possibility
2. Biological Possibility
3. Logical Possibility
4. Law Possibility
5. Physical Possibility
6. Logical Possibility
7. This argument needs to be considered under a certain setting that described in the TV show, fiction, game, etc. (Because we haven’t seen any real zombie in life)

B.   

1. Logically Possible. The streets are covered under a huge umbrella.
2. Logically Possible. There is a hole that passes through the center of the Earth, so the rock will do periodic motion in that hole, but never touch any surface.
3. Logically Possible. Jessica gets re-animated and goes to work.
4. Logically Possible. Getting higher scores in IQ tests might not necessarily means “smarter”, so both claims “Women are smarter than men. Men score higher on IQ tests than women.” could co-exist.
5. Logically impossible. She must be popular if everyone loves her.
6. Logically possible. In someone mind, Shakespeare might not be the greatest English-speaking playwright of all time, but the Sam Shepard is.

C.    

1. By definition of the word “triangle”, it must have 3 sides. This is logically impossible for a triangle to have 4 sides.
2. Sandy couldn’t be in the state of “coming to party” and “not coming to party” at the same time. This is logically impossible. 
3. The first sentence shows that open flame leads to oxygen. Then it mentions that there’s an open flame. So, it logically follows that there is oxygen. But it also said there is no oxygen. This is a contradiction, and it’s not logically possible.
4. Lewis couldn’t be taller than himself. This is logically impossible.
5. Rene couldn’t perform thinking if he didn’t exist. This is logically impossible.
6. Things can’t get better or worser when they stay the same. This is logically impossible.
7. First two sentences indicates that I’m in France. So, it’s not logically impossible that you are also not in France. 
8. Jolene runs a four-minute mile. Having some ever run a four-minute mile while claiming that nobody’s ever run a four-minute mile is logically impossible.

D.   

1. Invalid. Maybe the cat is invulnerable (using some magic) so it couldn’t get injured or killed.
2. Valid.
3. Invalid, John might be genetically modified to be able to breathe under water. So, he might not die. 
4. Valid.
5. Invalid. John could also be a kid.

 

Exercise 1.3

1. All domestic cats are pets. The argument is invalid without this assumption. Think about the domestic cats that get abandoned, they are no longer pets.
2. All cats are warm-blooded. It’s valid without assumption. Since cats, by definition, are mammals, and mammals by definition are warm-blooded.
3. Anyone who votes for Gil Fulbright is Republican. The argument is invalid without this assumption. Voting for Gil Fulbright provides no information that you are a Republican. Voter might be a Democrats or Independent Voter. 
4. It will snow in January. The argument is invalid without this assumption. Not every place will snow (like desert).
5. The day after yesterday is today. It’s valid without assumption. Since yesterday was just the day before today, so the day after the day before today is just today, this could be logically deducted.
6. All humans bitten by a tick will get Lyme disease.
7. Negatively charged particles repel each other. The argument is invalid without this assumption. The physical laws could be that negatively charged particles attract each other.
8. Selecting I (under this context) as senior prom is way of showing hatred to her parents. The argument is invalid without this assumption. Maybe she selects “I” simply because she loved “me”.
9. Appendectomy is a surgical procedure. It’s valid without assumption. Since “six weeks ago” is within “in the past year”, and by definition the “appendectomy” is a surgical removal of appendix.
10. The car that I am currently driving requires more than half a gallon of gas to drive 140 miles without refueling. The argument is invalid without this assumption. Maybe my car is super-efficient that I half a gallon of gas could drive more than 140 miles.

C.    

1. Valid
2. Invalid. Having facts that Los Angeles is bigger than both New York and San Francisco doesn’t provide any information about the size between New York and San Francisco. 
3. Invalid. Lincoln is dead but Clinton is still alive doesn’t mean Lincoln was president before Clinton. 
4. Invalid. There might be a third candidate for the election, defeating Bush doesn’t automatically make Clinton the next president.
5. Invalid. Maybe the Empire State Building is just tall so you could see Brooklyn that is in another city, just from the top of the building.
6. Valid.
7. Invalid. Although the Himalayas contain more tall mountains, it doesn’t mean it contains the highest mountains on earth. Therefore, knowing that Mount Everest is the highest mountain in Himalayas doesn’t mean it’s the highest mountain on earth.
8. Invalid. “Successful Olympic swimmers *typically* win more medals than other athletes”, so this doesn’t mean that Successful Olympic swimmer *always* wins more medals than other athletes. So, it’s not valid. 
9. Invalid. Brazil which is close to a South America country doesn’t mean it’s in South America.
10. Invalid. President doesn’t necessarily need to live in one’s office.

D.   I have not found such cases.
