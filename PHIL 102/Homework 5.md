2. I could find all the children that display certain symptom of lead poisoning, and investigate the toys the used, the water they drink, and whether their house uses lead paint to see if there are anything in common. (Method of agreement). If after the contaminated water has been eliminated, there are still lead poisoning, that means the contaminated water is not only the sole cause of the lead poisoning in this area.

#### Exercise 5.4

##### (A)

1. Ice cream sales causes murders. Confounds: High temperature causes the increase of ice-cream sales and more violence, hence murders.
2. Being a math major students causes high GRE quantitative score. Confounds: People with better quantitative ability will choose to study math and get a better GRE quantitative score.
3. Watching violent television in childhood causes people to be more violent as they grown up. Confounds: people who are genetically predisposed to be violent will more likely to watch violent television in childhood and become violent when they are adult.
4. Owning guns causes increased likelihood of being shot. Confounds: people who do illegal activity are more likely buy guns, and also more likely being shot in these activities.

15. Traffic congestion around large arena or stadiums causes national alcohol sales. Confounds: National alcohol sales cause increased traffic to buy the alcohol, and this causes traffic congestion.

##### (B)

1. Death penalty does not cause decrease in crime rate. Observational Study without controls (Retrospective). It's relatively weak. We need to see the serious crime rates, and maybe the jurisdiction system and more thorough data about all different kinds of crime.
2. Aspartame causes precancerous tumors. Interventional study (method of difference). It's relatively strong. We probably need more sample to be collected, 22 + 23 is not a convincing amount of data.
3. DEET is better mosquito repellants than picaridin. Interventional study. It's weak, there is only one person being tested. Also, the situation on left-arm might be different than right-arm (the speaker uses his right arm more so that it attracts more mosquito). So more test on different people is needed (more data)
4. DEET is better mosquito repellants than picaridin. Interventional study. It's also weak, changing from one person to two people doesn't help. The sample size is too small. We need more data.
5. A Mediterranean diet might reduce your risks of heart disease. Observational study with controls (Retrospective). It's relatively weak. There might also be other condition that needs to be considered like climate, local environment, and so on. We need more information on that (and find data where they are the same) to determine the hypothesis.

#### Exercise 5.5

1. (i) your children might get depressed if your pressure them to hard, and in this case they will not have a happy life. (ii) Getting straight A doesn't mean they will get into a very good college. Graduate doesn't guarantee they will find a good job. Successful in getting a good job doesn't mean they will have a happy life. The job they find might stress themselves out. (iii) This paragraphs has 4 causations, and they are not very plausible as I pointed out.
2. (i) Spending more money are goods and services might cause inflation, and that might cause the average people change their currency into assets, and the money circulating in the economy will not increase, and the economy will not become better. (ii) Having more money doesn't mean people will spend it. If people are pessimistic about the future of the economy and the country, they will try to save their money rather than spending it. (iii) This paragraphs has 6 causations, and they are not very plausible as I pointed out.
3. (i) Raise taxes on the rich might cause them to flee the country with their money, this could decrease the money in the economy, which make it worse. (ii) Making infrastructure better does not cause the economy to become better directly, this needs some professional knowledge to answer. (iii) It has few causations, and they are not very plausible as I pointed out.
4. (i) You might hurt yourself if there is a gun in your house (ii) Showing the gun might not scare them off, if they also have guns. (iii) It has few causations, and they are somewhat plausible, but it needs more scrutiny.
