>What is an argument, and how is it different from an explanation?

An ***argument*** is a set of sentences consisting of one or more *premises* and a *conclusion*. 

>Explain the difference between a *deductive* and an *inductive* argument

An argument is ***deductive*** if the truth of premises would guarantee the truth of the conclusion; An argument is ***inductive*** if the truth of premises would render the truth of the conclusion probable.

***deductive argument*** is one that *aims* at *validity*.



> “If [the skeptics] say, ‘What if you are mistaken?’ – well, if I am  mistaken, I am. For one who does not exist can by no means be mistaken. Therefore, I am, if I am mistaken. Because, if I am mistaken that I am, how can I be mistaken [in thinking] that I am, since it is  certain that I am if I am mistaken. And because, if *I* could be mistaken, then *I* would have to be the one who is mistaken, therefore I am most certainly not mistaken in knowing that I am.”

(P11) For one who does not exist can by no means be mistaken

(C1, P21) If I am mistaken, I exist

(C2, P31) I could not be mistaken in thinking I exist

(P32) If I could be mistaken, then I would have to be the one who is mistaken.

(C) I am most certainly not mistaken in knowing that I exist

>"Not everyone knows that getting a flu shot reduces your chances of  getting the flu. If everyone knows that getting a flu shot reduces your chances of getting the flu, then everybody should get the shot. So,  not everybody should get the shot."

Consider the situation where:

(1) It's true that not everyone knows that getting a flu shot reduces your chances of getting the flu

(2) If someone don't get the shot, they die.

(3) One should prevent oneself from dying.

Therefore everyone should get the shot, other they will die. In this case the conclusion is false yet the premises are all true.



>“Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist.  This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one  side, you automatically help out that of the other. Nor is there any  real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In  practice, 'he that is not with me is against me'.” 

(P1) If you pamper the war effort on one side, you automatically help out that of the other.

(P2) there is not any real way of remaining outside such a war.

(C) Pacifism is objectively pro-fascist
