An **argument**, again, is a set of sentences consisting of one or more premises and a conclusion. 

The **premises** are statements that are offered as evidence for the conclusion.

The **conclusion** is the statement whose truth the argument is intended to establish. 

An argument is **deductive** if the truth of premises would guarantee the truth of the conclusion; 

An argument is **inductive** if the truth of premises would render the truth of the conclusion probable, without guaranteeing it.

An argument is **valid** if and only if it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false together.

An argument is **sound** if and only if it is valid and has all true premises.

This is a phenomenon known as the **belief** bias: people tend to judge invalid arguments to be valid if the conclusion is something they already believe to be true.

An incomplete argument is called an **enthymeme**.

A **counterexample**, a possible situation for which it is clear that the premises are true and the conclusion is false.

The **negation** of p, a sentence that is true exactly if p is false and vice versa.

**Indicative conditionals**: conditionals of the form “if p is true (or was true, or will be true), then q is (was, or will be) true.

A conditional asserts that the antecedent is a **sufficient condition** for the consequent and that the consequent is a **necessary condition** for the antecedent.

The conditional is false if the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

| Modus Ponens | Modus Tollens    | Affirming the consequent | Denying the antecedent     |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| if p then q  | if p then q      | if p then q              | if p then q                |
| p            | not-q            | q                        | not-p                      |
| therefore q  | therefore, not-p | therefore, p (invalid)   | therefore, not-q (invalid) |

**Principle of charity**: when reconstructing an argument, you should attempt to give the speaker the best argument you can reasonably attribute to them.

The simplest type of inductive argument is the **statistical syllogism**.
(P1) Most As are Bs.
(P2) x is an A.
(C) Therefore, x is a B.
(The “most” in (P1) could be replaced by another term to the same effect, including a precise numerical value; it could also be replaced by “few” and the conclusion would be that x is not a B.)

An **inductive** argument is one where the premises are only intended to render the conclusion probable.

>The conditional support conferred by an inductive argument comes in degrees. Unlike deductive arguments, we cannot generally give binary, black/white answers about whether a particular argument’s line of reasoning is successful. Some arguments will render a conclusion all but certain; some will barely lift its probability at all; many will be somewhere in between.

Musicians here is the **reference** class and People who can read music is the **attribute** class

> In general, you should draw inferences on the basis of the narrowest reference class for which you have statistical information.

This requirement is known as the **rule of total evidence**: the strength of an inductive argument is determined not just by what’s included in the argument, but by all the evidence we possess.

Failure to take relevant evidence into account is known as the **fallacy of exclusion**

**defeaters**: reasons not to accept a conclusion.

The defeaters we have been looking at are reasons to disbelieve a given conclusion, to believe its negation, to believe the conclusion to be false. These are known as **rebutting defeaters**

This kind of defeater is called an **undercutting defeater**. It doesn’t give us a reason to reject the conclusion; it gives us a reason to reject an argument for that conclusion.

One important instance is the **representativeness heuristic**: we estimate the probability that some item is a member of some class by forming a quick and dirty measure of how similar that item is to a stereotypical member of that class.

The short answer is that we use an argument of the following form:
(P1) n% of observed As are Bs.
(C) So, (approximately) n% of As are Bs.
This type of argument is known as **inductive generalization** (IG).

Inferring an inductive generalization on the basis of too small a sample results in committing the **fallacy of hasty generalization**.

The **outgroup homogeneity effect** is that we tend to overestimate the homogeneity of outgroups;

We’ll call this fallacy—of trying to reject a statistical claim by citing counterinstances—**the argument from counterinstances.**

**Availability heuristic**, where we judge something to be common or likely to the extent that it’s easy to think of examples. 

There’s a more direct way to get from premises about individuals to conclusions about other
individuals: the argument from analogy 

>(P1) x and y are similar in certain respects.
>(P2) x has feature F.
>(C) Therefore, y has F.

**Inference to the best explanation**, very common in the sciences and everyday life, is where we infer something unobserved on the grounds that it would explain the things we have observed

The **confirmation bias** is a tendency we have to seek, collect, and evaluate evidence in a way that tends to bias us in favor of what we already believe.

Causes are difference-makers: to say that one thing causes another is to say that the first makes a difference as to whether the second happens or not. Generally speaking, for A to be a difference-maker/cause of B, an associated counterfactual must be true: If A had not happened, then B would not have happened.

We can rationally judge that A causes B if there is a correlation between A and B and we have eliminated potential confounds

The truth of that premise is a function of the speaker’s sincerity and their competence

In assessing someone’s expertise we should carefully distinguish recognized experts, people who are widely regarded as experts in an area, and true experts, those who genuinely have the relevant expertise.

Sometimes people argue ad hominem: rather than directly addressing what the speaker said, they make some personal criticism of the speaker.

It’s called the fallacy of equivocation. This is when an argument uses a single word or phrase in two or more different ways, so that the argument has the appearance of being sound, even though it isn’t.

We have three main reasons to take established science seriously: the obvious success of science in predicting and manipulating the world through technology, the default assumption that people are generally truthful, and finally, the institutional structure of science itself, which is quite adversarial and in large measure self-correcting.

In Popper’s terminology: legitimate scientific theories are falsifiable.

Rhetoric often works by using emotions, either to influence reasoning (by
affecting our selection and appreciation of evidence) or to bypass reasoning
(inducing people to form beliefs by association with good or bad feelings,
rather than by evidence)

Begging the question (aka circular
reasoning) is the fallacy of assuming as a premise that which the argument
was hoping to establish. It is a dialectical fallacy rather than a logical
fallacy; it’s not bad reasoning so much as bad argumentation.
