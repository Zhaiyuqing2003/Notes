Statistical syllogism is an inductive form that resembles universal _modus ponens_ except that it has a **statistical premise** (a statement of the form "most As are Bs" or "n% of As are Bs"), where the other has a universal generalization ("all As are Bs"). If the statistical premise is "most As are Bs", A is the ***reference class***, and B is the ***attribute class***. We should draw our inference on the basis of the **narrowest reference class** we can

>27. What sis the rule of total evidence, the fallacy of exclusion and the relation between the two?

Induction is governed by the ***rule of total evidence:*** the strength of *any* inductive argument is determined by all the evidence we possess, not just what's internal to the argument; failure to abide by this rule amounts to the ***fallacy of exclusion.*** 

Personal Note: Failure to consider all the facts (like deliberately hide some facts) leads to fallacy of exclusion.
